I found this file as I was cleaning up some old code, for a project to implement
a <a href=https://github.com/AakashKT/CuckooHashingHLS>fast K/V store on an FPGA</a>,
so I thought I should put this up for anyone else who stumbles on the
same frustrations / errors. I'm not touching this particular toolchain again
with a 10-foot pole till the tools stabilize by <i>a lot</i>.
<h4><a id=vivado-hls-issues href='#vivado-hls-issues'> ยง </a> Vivado HLS issues</h4>
<ul><li> Unable to create BRAM for fields such as <code>bool</code>, <code>int16</code>. The data buses
  will be <code>8/16</code> bits long, with error:</li></ul>
<div class='code'></div>
<ul><li> I had an array of structs:</li></ul>
<div class='code'></div>
This gets generated as 3 ports for memory, of widths <code>1</code>, <code>16</code>, <code>16</code>. Ideally,
I wanted <i>one</i> port, of width <code>16+16+1=33</code>, for each struct value.
However, what was generated were three ports of widths <code>1</code>, <code>16</code>, and <code>16</code>
which I cannot connect to BRAM.
<ul><li> <code>data_pack</code> allows us to create one port of width <code>16+16+1=33</code></li></ul>
<ul><li> Shared function names allocated on BRAM causes errors in synthesis:</li></ul>
<div class='code'></div>
<ul><li> Enums causes compile failure in RTL generation  (commit <code>3c0d619039cff7a7abb61268e6c8bc6d250d8730</code>)</li><li> <code>ap_int</code> causes compile failurre in RTL generation (commit <code>3c0d619039cff7a7abb61268e6c8bc6d250d8730</code>)</li><li> <code>x % m</code> where <code>m != 2^k</code> is very expensive -- there must be faster encodings of modulus?</li><li> How to share code between HLS and vivado SDK? I often wanted to share constant values between
  my HLS code and my Zynq code.</li><li> Can't understand why array of structs that were packed does not get deserialized correctly. I had to manually
  pack a struct into a <code>uint32</code>. For whatever reason, having a <code>#pragma pack</code> did something to the representation of the struct
  as far as I can tell, and I couldn't treat the memory as just a raw <code>struct *</code> on the other side:</li></ul>
<div class='code'></div>
<ul><li> If I change my IP, there is no way to preserve the current connections in the
  GUI why just updating the "changed connections". I'm forced to remove the IP
  and add it again (no, the Refresh IP button does not work).</li><li> On generating a new bitstream from Vivado, Vivado SDK tries to reload the config,
  fails at the reloading (thinks <code>xil_print.h</code> doesn't exist), and then fails to compile code.
  Options are to either restart Vivado SDK, or refresh <code>xil_print.h</code>.</li></ul>
<ul><li> It is entirely unclear what to version control in a vivado project, unless one
  has an omniscient view of the <i>entire toolchain</i>. I resorted to <code>git add</code> ing
  everything, but this is a terrible strategy in so many ways.</li></ul>
<h4><a id=sdaccel-bugs href='#sdaccel-bugs'> ยง </a> SDAccel bugs</h4>
<b><a href=https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2017_1/ug1028-sdsoc-intro-tutorial.pdf>link to tutorial we were following</a></b>
<ul><li> The executable is named <code>.exe</code> while it's actually an ELF executable (The SDAccel tutorials say it is called as <code>.elf</code>)</li><li> the board is supposed to automatically boot into linux, which it does not. One is expected to call <code>bootd</code> manually (for "boot default") so it boots ito linux. (The SDAccel tutorials say it automatically boots into it)</li><li> At this point, the SD card is unreadable. It took a bunch of time to figure out that the SD card needs to be mounted by us, and has the mount name <code>/dev/mmcblk0p1</code>. (The SDAccel tutorials say that it should be automatically mounted)</li><li> At this point, we are unable to run <code>hashing.elf</code>. It dies with a truly bizarre error: <code>hashing.elf: command not found</code>. This is almost un-googleable, due to the fact that the same problem occurs when people don't have the correct file name.</li><li> I rewrote <code>ls</code> with <code>hashing.elf</code> to see what would happen, because I conjectured that the shell was able to run <code>coreutils</code>.</li><li> This dies with a different error <code>ls: core not found</code>. I'd luckily seen this during my android days, and knew this was from busybox.</li><li> This led me to google "busybox unable to execute executable", which led me to this <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1562071/how-can-i-find-which-elf-dependency-is-not-fulfilled>StackOverflow link</a> that clued me into the fact that the ELF interpreter is missing.</li><li> When I discovered this, I wound up trying to understand how to get the right ELF interpreter. <code>readelf -l <exe name></code> dumps out <code>[Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3]</code>. So, I bravely copied: <code>cp /lib/ld-linux.so.3 /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3</code>.</li><li> Stuff is <i>still</i> broken, but I now get <i>useful</i> error messages:</li></ul>
<div class='code'></div>
At this point, clearly we have some linker issues (why does <code>xocc</code> not correctly statically link? What's up with it? Why does it expect it to be able to load a shared library? <b>WTF is happening</b>). do note that this is <i>not</i> the way the process
is supposed to go according to the tutorial!
<ul><li> Of course, there's no static library version of <code>libxilinxopencl.so</code>, so that's a dead end. I'm completely unsure if the tutorial even makes sense.</li><li> This entire chain of debugging is full of luck.</li></ul>
<ul><li> <a href=https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2018_2/sdsoc_doc/compiling-and-running-applications-on-arm-processor-hjy1504034381720.html>Link talking about generating <code>BOOT</code> file</a></li></ul>
At some point, I gave up on the entire enterprise.
