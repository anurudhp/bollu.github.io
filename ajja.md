Udupi-Ajja/Grandpa:

- He was born at around the 1930s. WW2 was going on when he was a kid.         
  Of course, no records are kept, so we don't really know the details.         
- At 5 years, their mom and dad divorced.                                      
- Went to stay with mom.                                                       
- Mom was the most beautiful woman in town :P, and was great at chess.         
- For 2 years, lived in mangalore. Mom was a nurse. He knows about WW2         
  as a small child, since he mentioned that this impacted their life.          
- She passed away from TB.                                                     
- He learnt Koknaki while he lived there.                                      
- He moved in with his dad after his mom died.                                 
- Great grandpa hated him, because he deserted him. Ajja was sent              
  to work in the fields.                                                       
- Ajja always wanted to study.                                                 
- He was sent (sold?) to Kargal (close to Joga). Unclear for how many years.   
  Worked at a hotel.                                                           
- At the hotel, someone told him about Ujire [Dharmastala]. He ran away        
  to the gurukul.                                                              
- He learnt Sanskrit, Vedas, etc. there till 11th grade. This is known         
  _as fact_, cause the person who taught him Sanskrit used to come home.       
  Supposedly always came first in class.                                       
- Bhide taught him English at the gurukul.                                     
- While he was at the gurukul, he worked(?) at Bhide's house. This is known    
  cause their families know each other.                                        
- After his SSLC, he came to Udupi and studied his 12th/13th grade             
  [intermediate] at MGM college. He was a science major.                       
- Grab one meal a day at the Krishna temple.                                   
- He and his friend Kedlaya grabbed a job at the LIC right after 12th grade.   
- After 3-4 years of joining the LIC, he fell very sick. That was when         
  he realized he wishes to get married ;) There was _no one_ for him           
  when he fell sick.                                                           
- He apparently then went to his dad and said "If you don't get me married,    
  then I'm going to marry someone regardless" to spur his family into action?  
- He then learnt that there was someone at Narkata. He went there, and he was  
  speaking there. Grandmom came, knocked the jug of water on the table and     
  rushed off in anger. Supposedly this was love at first sight :P              
  "Her fiery spirit" and all that.                                             
- Grandpa's dad took dowry from the wedding and pocketed it. Grandpa was       
  against the dowry, he learnt of this much later.                             
- Passed away in 2003, ~70 years.
