#[Hyperbolic groups have solvable word problem](#hyperbolic-groups-have-solvable-word-problem)

I have never seen an elementary account of this in a 'trust these facts, now
here is why hyperbolic groups have a solvable word problem'. I am writing
such an account for myself. It's an account for building intuition, so no
proofs will be provided except for the final theorem. All facts will be backed
by intuition. Since most of it is geometric, it's easy to convey intuition.

### Graphs of groups, quasi-isometry.
- **NOTE:** I will consistently denote the inverse of $g$ by $g'$.

We can convert any group into a graph by using the cayley graph of the group.
We characterize hyperbolic space as a space where we can build 'thin triangles'.
We also think of hyperbolic space as where geodesics from a given point
diverge (in terms of angle) exponentially fast. 

The choice of generators for the cayley graph gives different graphs. We can
assign a **unique** geometric object by considering cayley graphs upto quasi
isometry. The cayley graph of a group with respect to different generating sets
are quasi-isometric. We can now try to study properties that are invariant
under quasi-isometry, since these are somehow 'represented faithfully by the geometry'.

### Hyperbolicity enters the picture
We now say that a graph is hyperbolic if the cayley graph of the group is
hyperbolic. We can show that hyperbolicity is preserved by quasi-isometry.
So this property does not depend on the generating set.

### Isoperimetric Inequality

If we have a finitely presented group $G = \langle S | R \rangle$, and $w$
is a word in the free group $Free(S)$, if $[[w]] = 1$, we will have 

$$
w = \prod_{i=1}^n u_i r_i^{\pm 1} u_i' 
$$

This follows almost by definition. Since we have quotiented by $r$ we can have
elements of $r$ in between $u u'$. We will need to have a $u'$ since there's
nothing else to cancel off the $u$.

##### Area of a word
Let $G = \langle S | R \rangle$. Let $w$ be a word in $S$ such that $[[w]] = e$.
The area of the word $w$ is the minimal number of such $u r u'$ components
we need to write it down. Formally:

$$
Area(w) = \min { n | \prod_{i=1}^n u_i r+i^{\pm 1} u_i'}
$$

I don't understand the geometric content of this definition. I asked
[on mathoverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/363455/geometric-content-of-area-of-a-word-in-geometric-group-theory).


##### Isopermetric function for a group

$f: \mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$ is a Dehn function or isoperimetric function
if the area of the word is upper bounded by $f(|word|)$. In some sense, the
length of the word is the perimeter to the area, and this gives us a form
of the isoperimetric inequality. Formally, $f$ is a Dehn function if for all
words $w \in F(S)$ such that $[[w]] = e$, we have $A(w) \leq f(|w|)$. depending
on the growth of $f$, we say that $G$ has linear, quadratic, exponential etc.
Dehn function. 

##### Geometric content of Area

We define a map to be aninite, planar, oriented, connected and simply connected simplicial2-complex (!). 
A map $D$ is a diagram over an alphabet $S$ iff every edge $e \in D$ has a label $lbl(e) \in S$ such that
$lbl(e^{-1}) = (lbl(e))^{-1}$. Hang on: what does it mean to invert an edge?
I presume it means to go backwards along an edge. So we assume the graph is
directed, and we have edges in both directions.

A Van Kampen diagram over a group $G = \langle S | R \rangle$  is a diagram $D$
over $S$ such that for all faces of $D$, the label of the boundary of $f$
is labelled by some $r^{\pm} : r \in R$. The area of such a diagram
is the number of faces.


### Hyperbolic iff Linear Isopermetric Inequality is satisfied
A finitely presented group is hyperbolic if and of if its cayley grah
satisfies the linear isoperimetric inequality. 

### Deciding if elements are conjugate to each other

- If we can answer the question of whether two elements are conjugate to each
  other (does there exist a $g$ such that $ghg' =?= k$), we can solve
  that an element is equal to the identity:
-   Pick $k = e$. Then if we have $ghg' = k = e$, then $gh = g$ hence $h = e$.

- If we can check that an element is equal to the identity, we can check for
  equality of elements. two elements $k, l$ are equal iff $kl' = e$.

- So solving conjugacy automatically allows us to check of equality.


### Proof that conjugacy is solvable for hyperbolic groups

```
e------------------x----------------------->x
|                                           |
g2                                          g1
|                                           |
v                                           v
g1 =x g1 x'<-------x'--------------------- x g1
```

Assume such an element `x` exists such that `g2 = x g1 x'`.

Now we have two triangles, `e-x-xg1` and `xg1-x'-g2`. Let us focus on
`e-x-xg1`. Assume the triangles in our space is $delta$ thin.

```
         α = δ
e------------------x----‖------------------>x
 \_______               ‖                   |
         \________      ‖    > δ            |
                  \_____p====================
                           \________        |
                                    \_______xg1
```

Since our triangles are $\delta$ thin, if the distance of the point $p \in [e xg1]$
to  $$$$

#[Elementary uses of Sheaves in complex analysis](#elementary-uses-of-sheaves-in-complex-analysis)

I always wanted to see sheaves in the wild in a setting that was both
elementary but 'correct': In that, it's not some perverse example
created to show sheaves (DaTaBaSeS arE ShEAvEs). Ahlfors has a great example
of this which I'm condensing here for future reference.

### Sheafs: Trial 1

- We have function elements $(f:  \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb C, \Omega \subseteq \mathbb C)$.
  $f$ is complex analytic, $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\mathbb C$.
- Two function elements $(f_1, \Omega_1), (f_2, \Omega_2)$ are said to be analytic
  continuations of each other iff $\Omega_1 \cap \Omega_2 \neq \emptyset$, and
  $f_1 = f_2$ on the set $\Omega_1 \cap \Omega_2)$.
- $(f_2, \Omega_2)$ can be called as the continuation of $(f_1, \Omega_1)$ to
  region $\Omega_2$.
- We will have that the analytic continuation of $f_1$ to $\Omega_2$ is unique.
  If there exists a function element $(g_2, \Omega_2)$, $(h_2, \Omega_2)$ such that
  $g_2 = f_1 = h_2$ in the region $\Omega_1 \cap \Omega_2$, then by analyticity,
  this agreement will extend to all of $\Omega_2$.
- Analytic continuation is therefore an equivalence relation (prove this!)
- A chain of analytic continuations is a sequence of $(f_i, \Omega_i)$ such that
  the adjacent elements of this sequence are analytic continuations of each other.
  $(f_i, \Omega_i)$ analytically continues $(f_{i+1}, \Omega_{i+1})$.
- Every equivalence class of this equivalence relation is called as a global
  analytic function. Put differently, it's a family of function elements
  $(f, U)$ and $(g, V)$ such that we can start from $(f, U)$ and build
  analytic continuations to get to $(g, V)$.

### Sheafs: Trial 2

- We can take a different view, with $(f, z \in \mathbb C)$ such that $f$
  is analytic at some open set $\Omega$ which contains $z$. So we should
  picture an $f$ sitting analytically on some open set $\Omega$ which contains $z$.
- Two pairs $(f, z)$, $(f', z')$ are considered equivalent if $z = z'$ and
  $f = f'$ is some neighbourhood of $z (= z')$.
- This is clearly an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are called as _germs_.
- Each germ $(f, z)$ has a unique projection $z$. We denote a germ of $f$ with projection $z$
  as $f_z$.
- A function element $(f, \Omega)$ gives rise to germs $(f, z)$ for each $z \in \Omega$.
- Conversely, every germ $(f, z)$ is determined by some function element $(f, \Omega)$
  since we needed $f$ to be analytic around some open neighbourhood of $z$: Call
  this neighbourhood $\Omega$.
- Let $D \subseteq \mathbb C$ be an open set. The set of all germs $\{ f_z : z \in D \}$ 
  is called as a _sheaf_ over $D$. If we are considering analytic $f$ then
  this will be known as the _sheaf of germs of analytic functions over $D$_. This
  sheaf will be denoted as $Sh(D)$.
- There is a projection $\pi: Sh(D) \rightarrow D; (f, z) \mapsto z$. For a fixed $z0 \in D$,
  the inverse-image $\pi^{-1}(z0)$ is called as the _stalk over $z0$_. It is
  denoted by $Sh(z)$.
- $Sh$ carries both topological and algebraic structure. We can give _the sheaf_
  a topology to talk about about continuous mappings in and out of $Sh$.
  It also carries a pointwise algebraic structure at each stalk: we can
  add and subtract functions at each stalk; This makes it an abelain group.

#### Sheaf: Trial 3

A sheaf  over $D$ is a topological space $Sh$ and a mapping $\pi: Sh \rightarrow D$
with the properties:
- $\pi$ is a local homeomorphism. Each $s \in S$ has an open neighbourhood $D$
  such that $\pi(D)$ is open, and the restriction of $\pi$ to $D$ is a homeomorphism.
- For each point $z \in D$, the stalk $\pi^{-1}(z) \equiv S_z$ has the structre of an abelian
  group.
- The group operations are continuous with respect to the topology of $Sh$.

We will pick $D$ to be an open set in the complex plane; Really, $D$ can
be arbitrary.

## Why homomorphisms for chain maps?

First of all, to define a mapping between simplicial complexes $\{ G_i \}$
and $\{ H_i \}$, one might naively assume that we can ask for _functions_
$\{ f_i: G_i \rightarrow H_i \}$:

```
       ∂    ∂
    G3 → G2 → G1 → 0
    |    |    |
    f    g    h
    ↓    ↓    ↓  
0 → H3 → H2 → H1
      ∂    ∂
```


Unfortunately, to be able to use the
machinery of Homology, we need the $\{ f_i \}$ to be abelian group homomorphisms.
However, this is no great loss. Intuitively, when we want to map complexes,
we first say where the _generators_ of the abelian group ($\mathbb Z$-module)
maps to; Everything else is determined by the generators. This aligns
nicely with our intuition of what a map between complexes should look like:
we tell where the geometry goes ("this edge goes there"), and the algebra
is "dragged along for the ride". This gives us the diagram:

```
    G3--∂-→G2--∂-→G1 
    |      |      |
    f3     f2     f1
    ↓      ↓      ↓
0 →H3--∂-→H2--∂-→H1
```

where the `fi` are _homomorphisms_. So, this means we can talk about kernels and
images!

```
    Ker(f3)----→Ker(f2)--→Ker(f1)
       |         |          |
       ↓         ↓          ↓
       G3--∂----→G2----∂---→G1--→ 0 
       |         |          |
       f3        f2         f1
       ↓         ↓          ↓  
    Im(f3)--∂--→Im(f2)--∂-→Im(f1)
```

```
F → E → V → {0}
{0} → {e} → {v} → {0} 
```

The _Snake Lemma_ gives us a mapping $d: Ker(f1) \rightarrow Im(f3)$ such that
this long exact sequence is saatisfied:


## What do we wish to compute?

- Now that we've agreed that this family of maps $\{ f_i : G_i \rightarrow H_i \}$
  ought to be structured maps, the next question is "OK, now what? What does
  one want to determine"? Ideally, we would get a _new_ chain complex which
  I tacitly denote as $\{ f(G_i) \}$, consisting of the image of $G_i$ inside
  $H_i$ and the ability to determine its structure.

- However, this is the boring bit. We don't _really_ care about the _chain complex_ $\{ f(G_i) \}$ per se.
  What we _actually_ care about are the homology groups! So we would really like a tool
  that allows us to compute $H_i(f(G))$ in some convenient fashion.


# [Kernel, cokernel, image](#kernel-cokernel-image)

Consider a linear map $T: X \rightarrow Y$. we want to solve for $\{ x : T(x) = y0 \}$. 
- If we have an $x0$ such that $T(x0) = y0$, then see that $T(x0 + Ker(T)) = T(x0) + T(Ker(T)) = y0 + 0 = y0$.
  So the kernel gives us our degrees of freedom: how much can we change around without
  changing the solution.
- Now consider the cokernel: $Coker(T) = Y / Im(T)$. If we want to find 
  a solution $\{ x : T(x) = y0 \}$. If we have $y0 \neq 0 \in Coker(T)$, then
  the solution set is empty. The cokernel tells us the _obstruction_ to a 
  solution.

# [The commutator subgroup](#the-commutator-subgroup)

Define the commutator of $g, h$ as $[g, h] \equiv ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$.
The subgroup **generated** by all commutators
in a group is called as the commutator subgroup. Sometimes denoted as
$[G, G]$.

- We need to consider generation. Consider the free group on 4 letters
  $G = \langle a, b, c, d \rangle$. Now $[a, b] \cdot [c, d]$ has no
  expression in terms of $[\alpha, \beta]$. 

- In general, the elements of the commutator subgroup will be products
  of commutators. 

- It measures the degree of non-abelian-ness of the group. $G/[G, G]$ is
  the largest quotient of $G$ that is abelian. Alternatively, $[G, G]$
  is the smallest normal subgroup we need to quotient by to get an abelian
  quotient. This quotienting is called abelianization.


# [Simplicity of A5 using PSL(2, 5)](#simplicity-of-a5-using-psl-2-5)

#### Presentation of A5

We take as faith A5 has the presentation:

```
<a, b | a^2 = b^3 = (ab)^5 = 1>
```

If I find a nice proof of this isomorphism, or some other way to derive
the fact that `PSL(2, 5)` is isomorphic to `A5`, I will fill this up.

#### Step 1: `PSL(2, 5)` is isomorphic to `A5`

PSL(2, 5) consists of projective Mobius transformations with function composition
as the group operation. Here, we freely use the linear algebraic relationship
between transformations of the form `(az + b)/(cz + d)` and matrices `[a b; c z]`.


$$
\begin{align*}
&a, b, c, d \in \mathbb Z5, ad - bc = 1 \\
&f: \mathbb Z5 \cup \{ \infty \} \rightarrow \mathbb Z5 \cup \{ \infty \} \\
&f(z) \equiv (az + b)/(cz + d) \\
\end{align*}
$$

- We allow coefficients for the Mobius transform to be from $\mathbb Z5$,
  and we allow the domain and codomain of the function to be projectivized: so we
  add a point at infinity to $\mathbb Z5$.

- We construct a map from $PSL(2, 5)$ to $A5$ and then show that this map is
  an isomorphism. We exploit the presentation of $A5$ to find elements
  $a, b \in PSL(2, 5)$ such that $p^2 = q^3 = (pq)^5 = I$. We can link this
  to the presentation of A5 which requires precisely those relations.

- For an element of order 3, we pick `q(z) = 1/(1-z)`. 

$$
\begin{align*}
&q(z) = 1/(1-z) \\
&q(q(z)) = \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{1-z}}  \\
&         = \frac{1}{\frac{(1-z) - 1}{1-z}} \\
&         = \frac{(1-z)}{-z} = \frac{(z-1)}{z}  \\
&         = 1 - \frac{1}{z} \\
&q(q(q(z))) = 1 - \frac{1}{q(z)} = 1 - (1 - z) = z
\end{align*}
$$

- I don't know of a principled way to arrive at this choice of `q(z)`, except
  by noticing that `az + b` does not work, and neither does `1/z`. The next
  simplest choice is things of the form `1/(1-z)`. If there is a nicer way,
  I'd love to know.

- For a function of order $5$, we have to use the structure of the finite field
  somehow. We can consider the function `r(z) = 1 + z`. On repeating this 5
  times, we wil get `5 + z = z`. However, it is hard to connect `r(z) = 1 + z`
  to the  previous choice of `q(z) = 1/(1-z)`. 

- We use the same idea for `r(z)`, and pick `r(z) = z - 1`. This will allow
  us to accumulate `-1`s till we hit a `-5 = 0`.

- To get `r(z) = (z - 1)`, we need to compose `q(z) = 1/(1-z)` with `p(z) = -1/z`.
  This `p(z)` is of order 2.

To recap, we have achieved a set of functions:

```
p(z) = -1/z [order 2]
q(z) = 1/(1-z) [order 3]
r(z) = (z - 1) [order 5]
r = -1/[1/(1-z)] = p . q
```


That is, we have found a way elements in `PSL(2, 5)` such that `p^2 = q^3 = (pq)^5 = 1`.
This gives us the [surjective] map from `PSL(2, 5)` into `A5`.


- By a cardinality argument, we know that the size of `PSL(2, 5)` is 60. Hence,
  since `PSL(2, 5)` and `A5` have the same number of elements, this map
  must be a bijection.

#### Step 2: PSL(2, 5) is simple

TODO! I'm still reading Keith Conrad's notes.

# [A5 is not solvable](#a5-is-not-solvable)

There are many accounts of why A5 is not solvable on the internet. I'm recording my
version here, because the proof involves certain ad-hoc choices which I want
to make sure I can find off-hand in the future.
We'll show that `[A5, A5] = A5`, thereby proving that `A5` not solvable.
This is useful for Galois theory, where we want to show tha `A5` cannot be
built as extensions of smaller cyclic groups. 

### Notation

I'll be using non-standard notation: `(12);(34)` means 'perform `(12)` then perform `(34)`'.
I find this notation makes permutation composition intuitive for me. The `;` 
is evocative of C-style languages, where we are ending a statement. I will
be consistently using $[g, h] \equiv ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$ to denote the commutator.

### permutations in A5

First, recall that `A5` only has the _even_ permutations in `S5`. So it can
have zero, two, four, involutions that build it up. There can't be more after
simplification, since `S5` ony has `5` elements --- the largest sequence
of transpositions we can do is `(12)(23)(34)(45)`. So, in `A5`, we have:

- The identity permutation `()`.
- The transpositions `(ij)(kl)` where `{i, j}` and `{k, l}` do not overlap.
  From these, we get the 2-cycles.
- The transpositions `(ij)(kl)` where `{i, j}` and `{k, l}` overlap. Here we
  cannot have `{i, j} = {k, l}` since then we will just have a single transposition.
  So, let us assume that we have `j = k`. If we have any other equality, we
  can always flip the transpositions around to get to the normal form `j = k`:

```
(23);(12)
= (32);(12) [(23) = (32)]
= (32);(21) [(12) = (21)]
```

- In this case, we can show that such a transposition _must_ be a cycle:

```
[a b c] -(32)->
[a c b] -(21)->
[c a b]
```

- Intuitively, we are pushing the element `c` backward, and allowing the
  other elements to take its place using the permutation `(23);(12)`.

- So, from the transpositions of the form `(ij)(kl)` where `{i, j}` and
  `{k, l}` intersect, we get the 3-cycles.

- Finally, we can have the transpositions of the form `(12)(23)(34)(45)`. 
  It must be of this form, or some permutation of this form. Otherwise,
  we would have repeated elements, since these transpositions are packed
  "as close as possible". These generate the 5-cycles.

### A5 is generated by 3-cycles.

We claim that we can write any element of $A5$ in terms of 3-cycles.

- The disjoint transpositions of the type `(34)(12)` can be written as
  `(34)(23)(23)(12)`, because `(23)(23) = e`. This can be further
  broken down into `((34)(23)) ((23)(12))` which is two 2-cycles: 
  `(234); (123)`.

- The non-disjoint transpositions of the type `(32)(21)` _are_ 3-cycles:
  `(32)(21) = (123)`.

- 3-cycles are 3-cycles.

- Any 5-cycle an be written as two 3-cycles: `(45)(34)(23)(12)` can be written
  as `((45)(34))((23)(12))` which is two 3-cycles: `(345); (123)`.

So, if we figure out how to write 3-cycles in terms of commutators, we win.
Because the commutator subgroup of $A_n$ is generated by elements that
can be written as $[g, h]$. If we can show that 3-cycles can be written
as $[g, h]$, then every other element has a representation in terms of
these 3-cycles, and are therefore elements of the commutator subgroup.


### 3-cycles can be generated as commutators of 2-cycles:

- We saw how we can write a 3-cycle of the form `C = (123)` as `(32)(21)`.
  We wish to write this as the commutator of two elements `g, h`: $C = [g, h]$.

- The idea is that we have the leftover elements `4, 5` that are unsused by `C` in `A5`
  [here is where `5` is important: `3 + 2 = 5`, and we need two leftover elements].

- We can use these two leftover elements `4, 5` to build elements `g, h`
  which cancel off, leaving us with `(32)(21)`. We start with `g = (32)___`,
  `h = (21)___` where the `___` is to be determined:

```
(32)___||(21)___||___(32)||___(21)
  g        h        g^-1    h^-1
```

- It is important that `g` and `h` contain another tuple, because they are
  members of `A5`! We need them to be permutations having `2, 4, 6` transpositions.
  

- We insert `(4 5)` everywhere. These `(4 5)` can slide over the `(2 1)` and thereby
  harmlessly cancel:


```
(32)(45)||(21)(45)||(45)(32)||(45)(21)
  g        h           g^-1       h^-1
```

- Simplify the above expression by moving the `(45)` over `(21), (32)`:

```
(32)||(21)(45)(45)||(32)||(45)(45)(21)
  g      h          g^-1    h^-1
```

- cancel the `(45)(45) = e`:

```
(32)||(21)||(32)||(21)
  g   h    g^-1   h^-1
```

                                                
So we are left with `(32);(21);(32);(21)`. This is the _square_ of what
we really wanted, `C = (32);(21)`. However, since `C` is a 3-cycle, we know
that $C = C^{-2}$. So, we can start with $C^{-1}$, use our trick to generate
$C^{-2}$ which is equal to $C$. Since this works for any $C$, we have shown
that we can generate 3-cycles from commutators of `A5`.

### Alternate viewpoint on above proof

We have a 3-cycle `s = (a b c)`. We first first a square root `t` such 
that `t*t=s`. To do this, we make `t` have the cycles of `s` spread out
in gaps of 2:

```
t = (a _ _)
t = (a _ b) [+2]
t = (a c b) [+2, modulo]
```

It is hopefully clear that `t*t = s`:

```
t = (a c b)
t*t: apply the cycle twice.
t*t = a -(skip c) -> b
      b -(skip a) -> c
      c ->(skip b) -> a
    = (a b c) = s
```

Now, we will write `s = t*t` and then find the commutator decomposition from
it:

```
s = t*t
  = (abc)(abc)
  = (cb)(ba)(cb)(ba)
  = (cb)|(ba)|(cb)|(ba)
  = (cb)|(ba)|(cb)|(ba)
     g     h   g-1   h-1
```

But there's a problem: this `g` and `h` do not belong to `A5`, they belong
to `S5`. This is fixed by using a random `(pq)` which we know _will exist_.

### Recap: How have we shown that A5 is not solvable?

what have we shown?

- 3-cycles can be written as $[g, h]$ for $g, h \in A_5$. Alternatively,
  we can say that 3-cycles belong to the commutator subgroup of $A_5$,
  since they can be written as commutators.
- any element in $A5$ can be written as the composition of 3-cycles.
- Hence, any element in $A5$ can be written as the composition of commutators.


In my mind, I think of it as:

```
arbitrary g
= (3-cycle-1)(3-cycle-2)....(3-cycle-n)
= [g, h][g2, h2]....[gn, hn]
= member of [A5, A5]
```

Recall that $[A5, A5]$ is **generated** by commutators. It not only contains
elements of the form $[g, h]$, but also all products of the form $[g, h][g', h']$.
So we don't need to exhibit how to write a 5-cycle as some $[g, h]$. We just
need to exhibit how to write as the product of commutators, which we have
now shown.


### Solvable implies simple  

We can consider the other definition of simple. Let there be a
chain of normal subgroups $G = N[0] \leq N[1] \leq N[1] \leq \dots \leq N[m] = e$,
such that each quotient $N[i] / N[i+1]$ is abelian. Then, if $G$ is 
simple, this chain can only be $G = N[0] \leq N[1] = e$.

- If we want the quotient $G/N$ to be abelian, then we need the commutator
  subgroup $[G, G]$ to be a a subset of $N$.

- In our case, $[A_5, A_5] = A_5$. So if we want to remove the non-abelian-ness
  of A5, we need to quotient by the _whole_ of $A5$. 

- This means that any such chain will immediately collapse to $e$.

- So, it's impossible to build $A5$ using 'cycling components' starting from $\{e\}$.
  Viewed from the field theoretic perspective, this means that it's impossible
  to reach a polynomial whose splitting field has galois group A5 by simply 
  appending cycles.

### Nagging doubt: Did we depend on our numbering of cycles?

In all my proofs, I had used _one_ 3-cycle, or 5-cycle, or 2-cycle to
argue that it all works out. Is this really legal? Perhaps the argument
written for the 3-cycle `C = (123)` will break down for `D = (321)`. Fear not!

- We will show that all 3-cycles are conjugate to each other. So, we can always
  relabel a 3-cycle within A5.
- It is easy to note that $g[k, l]g^{-1} = [gkg^{-1}, glg^{-1}]$. This shows
  that the commutator subgroup is closed under conjugation. It better be,
  because it ought to be normal for us to take quotients from it.
- Combining these facts, if we show that `(123)` is in `[A5, A5]`, then some
  other cycle `(ijk)` can be conjugated to `(123)`. Since the commutator
  subgroup is closed under conjugation, we have that `(ijk)` is a member
  of `[A5, A5]`.


### All 3-cycles are conjugate to each other in A5.

- Given two 3-cycles `C=(abc)` and `D=(pqr)`, at least one of `a, b, c` must
  be equal to one of `p, q, r`. Since each `a, b, c` is unique, and each
  `p, q, r` is unique, for them to not overlap, we would need 6 elements. 
  But we only have 5, so there must be some overlap:

```
a   b   c
1 2 3 4 5
  p   q r
```

So, we will perform our proof assuming there is 1 overlap, 2 overlap, 3 overlap.
Recall that if `C = (a b c)` is a cycle and `s` is a permutation, then the action
of conjugating `C` with `s` produces a permutation `(s(a) s(b) s(c))`. We will
prove our results by finding an `s`, and then **making `s` even**. This is
the difficult part of the proof, since we need to show that all 3-cycles are
conjugate _in A5_. We will write `s` as two distinct transpositions, which will
guarantee that it belongs to `A5`.

                    
- Case 1: `(abx)` and `(pqx)` have a single element `x` in common:

```
C = (abx)
D = (pqx)

s: send a to p, b to q
s = (ap)(bq)
C = (abx) -conj s-> (pqx) = D
```

- Case 2: `(axy)` and `(pxy)` have two elements in common, `x` and `y`. Naively,
  we would pick `s: send x to y`. But this is odd, so this isn't a member of
  `A5`. To make it even, we rearrange `D = (pxy)` as `D = (yxp)`. This lets us
  go from `C` to `D` by relabelling `a` to `y`, `y` to `p`. This permutation
  is even since it has two distinct transpositions.

```
C = (axy)
D = (pxy) = (yxp) [cyclic property]

s: send a to y, y to p
s = (ay)(yp)

C = (axy) -conj s-> (yxp) = D
```

- Case 3: `(xyz)` and `(xyz)` have all three elements in common, `x`, `y`, `z`.
  Here we can conjugate by identity and we are done.
  

### Why do we care about solvable?

- Roughly, we can look at the solvability criterion as giving us a way to build
  our group $G$ from a series of extensions $N[1], N[2], \dots$. This extension
  is special, because at each step, we are adding a cyclic group.

- When we want to write a solution using nth roots, we can only add the
  nth roots of unity, a "cyclic" component. So, any element we can reach
  by using nth roots ought to be able to be written down as an extension of
  cyclic elements. 

### SAGE code to play around with commutators of `A5`:

- Create a dictionary `m` which maps each element of `A5` to the commutators
  that create it.

```py
from collections import defaultdict
m = defaultdict(set)
A5 = AlternatingGroup(5)
S5 = SymmetricGroup(5) # if necessary
for g in A5:
    for h in A5:
        m[g * h * g^(-1) * h^(-1)] |= { (g, h) }

# all 60 elem can be written in terms of commutators
print("number of elem generated as commutator: " + str(len(m.keys())))

# Show how to access elements of A5 and their commutator representation
cyc5 = A5("(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)")
cyc3 = A5("(1, 2, 3)")
cyc2disj = A5("(1, 2) (3, 4)")

print(m[cyc5])
print(m[cyc3])
print(m[cyc2disj])
```

### Writing each element in `A5` directly as a commutator

We have shown how to write 3-cycles as the commutator of 2-cycles. We will now
show how to do this for disjoint 2-cycles and 5-cycles as a matter of
enlightenment.

### Writing disjoint 2-cycles as commutator


First, we will write a two disjoint two cycles as the square root of
a 4-cycle. We will then show how to write this 4-cycle as two
3-cycles.

```
s = (12)(34) 
```

Note that if we choose `t = (abcd)`, then `t*t` will exchange the first
and third elements `a <-> c`, and the second and fourth elements `b <-> d`.
So, if we choose:

```
t = (1324)
t*t = (12) (34)
```

Next, we need to write this `t*t` as `[g, h]` for `g, h` from `A5`.

```
t*t = (1324)(1324)
    = (42)(23)(31);(42)(23)(31)
    = (42)(23)(31);(42)(23)(31)
    = (42)(23)(31);(23)(23);(42)(23)(31)
                   ^^^^^^^^ inserted
    = (42)(23)|(31)(23)|(23)(42)|(23)(31)
          g   |    h   |   g'   |   h'

    = [(42)(23), (31)(23)]
```

Where both `(42)(23)`, and `(31)(23)` are members of `A5`.

### Writing 3-cycle as commutator

In the description of showing how to generate 3-cycles, we do this
explicitly.


### Writing 5-cycle as commutator


Let `s = (1 2 3 4 5)`. we once again find a square root of `s`. To build
this, we will build an element with the elements of `s` written with
gaps of `2`:

```
t = (1 _ _ _ _) 
  = (1 _ 2 _ _)  [+2 index]
  = (1 _ 2 _ 3)  [+2 index, wrap]
  = (1 4 2 _ 3)  [+2 index, wrap]
  = (1 4 2 5 3)  [+2 index, wrap]
```

It should be clear how `t*t = s`: When we take `s = t*t`, the resulting permutation `s`
will move an element `j = t[i]` to `k = t[i+2]`. But we have built `t` such 
that `t[i+2] = s[i+1]`. So we will move the element according to how `s` pleases:

```
t = (1 4 2 5 3)
t*t = 1 -> (4 skip) -> 2 
      2 -> (5 skip) -> 3
      3 -> (1 skip) -> 4
      3 -> (2 skip) -> 5
      5 -> (3 skip) -> 1
t*t = (1 2 3 4 5) = s
```

We will now use `t*t` to write the commutator:

# [Complex orthogonality in terms of projective geometry](#complex-orthogonality-in-terms-of-projective-geometry)

If we think of complex vectors $p = [p_1, p_2]$, $q = [q_1, q_2]$ as belonging to
_projective space_: that is, $p \simeq p_1/p_2$, and $q \simeq q_1 / q_2$, we can
interpret orthogonality as:

$$
\begin{align*}
p . q = 0 \\
p_1 \overline q_1 + p_2 \overline q_2 = 0 \\
p_1 / p_2 = - \overline{q_2} / \overline{q_1} \\
p = -1/\overline{q} = -q/|q| \\

# [Arithmetic sequences, number of integers in a closed interval](#arithmetic-sequences-number-of-integers-in-a-closed-interval)

This is a cute reason for why when we count the number of integers in
the closed interval `[a, b]`, it's going to be `b - a + 1`. We setup
an arithmetic sequence with initial term `a`, common difference `1`. Now
we know that the `n`th term is `a + (n-1)d`. So, we get

```
a + (n-1)d = b
(n-1).1 = b - a
n = b - a + 1
```

#  [The arg function, continuity, orientation](#the-arg-function-continuity-orientation)

Let us think of the function $arg: \mathbb C \rightarrow \mathbb R$ as a multi
valued function, which maps each complex number to the set of possible
valid angles that generate it:

$$
arg(z) \equiv \{ t \in \mathbb R : |z|e^{i (\pi/2)t} = z  \}
$$

We plot the function here:

<img width=400 src="./static/arg-multi-value-circle.png">
<img width=400 src="./static/arg-multi-value-plot.png">


- Note that for every value $z \in C$, we get a _set_ of values associated
  to it.


#### Recovering single valued-ness

Now, the question is, can we somehow automatically recover single
valued-ness? kind of, by stipulating that for any given curve $c: [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb C$, 
the function $arg \circ c: [0, 1] \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is _continuous_. 

Let's try to investigate what happens if we move from `right` towards `bot`,
arbitrarily stipulating ("picking a branch") that `arg(right) = 0` as a sort
of basepoint.  

<img width=400 src="./static/arg-multi-value-branch-lower.png">

- Note that we were _forced_ to pick the value `arg(bot) = -1` from our
  considerations of continuity. No other value extends continuous from the
  right to the bottom.
- Also note that we got a *smaller* value: we move from `0 -> -1`: we decrease
  our value as we move clockwise.

This prompts the natural question:

> what happens if we move in the opposite direction?

#### Counter-clockwise movement

- Let's move counter-clockwise from `right`, arbitrarily picking the branch
  `arg(right) = 0` as before. This gives us:


<img width=400 src="./static/arg-multi-value-branch-upper.png">


- Note that once again, we were _forced_ to pick `arg(top) = 1` by continuity
  considerations.

- Also note that this time, we got a *larger* value: we move from `0 -> 1`: we
  increase our value as we move counter-clockwise


#### Multiple winding

the true power of this multi-valued approach comes from being able to handle
_multiple_ windings. Here the real meaning of being a multi-valued function shows
through. If we decide to go through the the loop _twice_, as:

```
bot -> right -> top -> left -> bot -> right -> top -> left
-1  -> 0     -> 1   -> 2    -> 3   -> 4     -> 5   -> 6
```

That is, we end up with the value `6`, which can only b



#### Orientation from continuity

There's something really elegant about being able to recover a notion of
"orientation" by simply:

1. Allowing multi-valued functions.
2. Forcing continuity constraints.
3. Interpreting increase/decrease in the value of the function.


#### Discretizing, gaining more insight

I was personally dis-satisfied with the above explanation, because it seemed
weird that we would need to depend on the history to define this function. We
can formalize this notion of history. Let's first discretize the situation,
giving us:

<img width=400 src="./static/discrete-multi-valued.png"/>

- We are on the space of the spokes, given by `a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h`.
- We have a function `f: Spoke -> Val` whose values are given on the spokes.
- We are interested in the path `p: Time -> Spoke`, `p = [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, a]`.
- If we evaluate the function `f` on the path `p`, we get `out: Time -> Val`, `out = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0]`.
- We have a "jump" from `7` to `0` in `out` as we cross from `h` to `a`. This is a
  discontinuity in `out` at time `7`.
- We want to fix this, so we make the function `f` multi-valued. 

<img width=400 src=./static/discrete-multi-valued-assign-multi-value.png>

- We assign both values `8` and `0` to the spoke `a`. We wish to define
  the evaluation of `f: Spoke -> 2^N` relative to path `p`. At time `t`, point
  `p[t]`, we pick any value in `f(p[t])` that makes `out[t]` continuous.

- So in this case, when we start, we have two choices for `out[0] = f(p[0]) = f(a)`: `0` and `8`.
  But we know that `out[1] = f(p[1]) = f(b) = 1`. Hence, for `out[0]` to be continuous, we must
  pick `out[0] = 0`.

- Similarly, at `out[8]` we have two choices: `0` and `8`. But we have that
  `out[7] = 7`, hence we pick `out[8] = 8`.

- Note that we say 'we pick the value' that makes `out` continuous.  This is
  not really rigorous. We can fix this by re-defining `f` in such a way
  that `f` is not `Spoke -> Val`, but rather it knows the full path:
  `f': (Time -> Spoke) -> Val`.

#### Making the theory path-dependent

We originally had:

```
path: Time -> Spoke
f: Spoke -> 2^Val -- multi-valued

-- | morally, not mathematically.
out: Time -> Val
out t = choose_best_value (f(path[t]))
```

But there was a vagueness in this `choose_best_value`. So we redefine it:

```
path: Time -> Spoke
f': (Time -> Spoke) -> Time -> Val
f'(path, tcur) = 
  argmax (\v -> |v - path[tcur-1]| + |v - path[tcur+1|)
         f(path[tcur])

out: Time -> Val
out = f'(path)
```

- The function `f'` that defines the value of the path has full
  access to the path itself!                                                      
- At time `tcur`, it attempts to pick the value in `f(path[tcur])` which
  makes the discontinuity as small as possible. It picks a value `v` from the
  possible values of `f(path[tcur])`. This `v` minimises the 
  of the distances from the previous time point (`|v - path[tcur-1]`), 
  and the distance from the next time point (`|v - path[tcur + 1]`).
- This provides a rigorous definition of what it means to "pick a value in the branch".
  This can clearly be extended to the continuous domain.

# [Odd partitions, unique partitions](#odd-partitions-unique-partitions)

A well known identity in combinatorics is that the partitions `n = l1 + l2 + ... + ln`
where each `li` is odd is in bijectiion with a partition where each `li` is unique.
I really liked this bijection.

# [Permutations-and-lyndon-factorization](#Permutations-and-lyndon-factorization)

For a string `s`, the Lyndon factorization writes `s` as the concatenation of
substrings `t1`, `t2`, ..., `tn`, such that:

- each `ti` is a simple word. That is, it is lexicographically smaller than all
  of its cyclic shifts.
- the words are in non-increasing order: `t1 >= t2 >= t3 ... >= tn`.

For example, given the word `banana`, the lyndon factorization is:

```
b; an; an; a; 
```

We can define a notation for writing permutation as:
- Each term in a cycle is written in _ascending_ order.
- Cycles are written in _descending_ order of the first element.
- Single element are ignored.

```
(7) (2 3) (1 4 5)
```

If we treat it as a string `723145`,
the duval algorithm provides the decomposition:

```
7; 23; 145; 
```

So, we can treat the duval algorithm as a way to recover the permutation given
the raw string. It's a nice way to _remember_ the definition of lyndon
decomposition if nothng else.

#[Crash course on domain theory](#crash-course-on-domain-theory)

In lambda calculus, we often see functions of the form $\lambda x \rightarrow x(x)$. We would
like a way to associate a "natural" mathematical object to such a function. The
most obvious choice for lambda calculus is to try to create a set $V$ of values
which contains its own function space: $(V  \rightarrow V) \subseteq V$. Unfortunately,
the only solution for this in sets is the trivial set $\{ * \}$.

### Computation as fixpoints of continuous functions

### CPOs

- Given a partial order $(P, \leq)$. assume we have a subset $Q \subseteq P$. 
  A least upper bound $u$ of $Q$ is an element that is the smallest element in $P$
  which is larger than every element in $Q$.

- A subset $Q$ of $P$ is called as a chain if its elements can be put into order.
  That is, there is a labelling of elements of $Q$ into $q1, q2, \dots, qn$ such
  that $q1 \leq q2 \leq \dots \leq qn$.

### CCPOs

- A partially ordered set is called as a _chain complete partial order_ if
  each chain has a least upper bound.

- This is different from a lattice, where each _subset_ has a least upper bound.

- Every ccpo has a minimal element given by $completion(\emptyset) = \lbot$.

- TODO: example of ccpo that is not a lattice


### Monotone map

- A function from $P$ to $Q$ is said to be monotone if $p \leq p' \implies f(p) \leq f(p')$.
  
- Composition of monotone functions is monotone.

- The image of a chain wrt a monotone function is a chain.

- A monotone function **need not preserve least upper bounds**. Consider:

$$
f: 2^{\mathbb N} \rightarrow 2^{\mathbb N}
f(S) \equiv
\begin{cases}
S & \text{$S$} is finite \\
S U \{ 0 \} &\text{$S$ is infinite}
\end{cases}
$$

This does not preserve least-upper-bounds. Consider the sequence of elements:

$$
A_1 = \{ 1\}, A_2 = \{1, 2\}, A_3 = \{1, 2, 3\}, \dots, A_n = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, n \}
$$

The union of all $A_i$ is $\mathbb N$.
Each of these sets is finite. 
Hence $f(\{1 \}) = \{1 \}$, $f(\{1, 2 \}) = \{1, 2\}$ and so on. Therefore:

$$
f(\sqcup A_i) = f(\mathbb  N) = \mathbb N \cup \{ 0 \}\\
\sqcup f(A_i) = \sqcup A_i = \mathbb N
$$

### Continuous function

- A function is continous if it is monotone and preserves all LUBs. This is
  only sensible as a definition on ccpos, because the equation defining it is:
  `lub . f  = f . lub`, where `lub: chain(P) \rightarrow P`. However, for `lub`
  to always exist, we need `P` to be a CCPO. So, the definition of continuous
  only works for CCPOs.

- The composition of continuous functions of chain-complete partially
  ordered sets is continuous. 

### Fixpoints of continuouts functions

The least fixed point of a continous function $f: D \rightarrow D$ is:

$$\texttt{FIX}(f) \equiv \texttt{lub}(\{ f^n(\lbot) : n \geq 0 \})$$


### $\leq$ as implication

We can think of $b \leq a$ as $b \implies a$. That is, $b$ has more information
than $a$, and hence implies $a$.

# [Parallelisable version of maximum sum subarray](#parallelisable-version-of-maximum-sum-subarray)

I learnt of a "prefix sum/min" based formulation from
[the solution to question D, codeforces educational round 88](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/78116).

The idea is to start with the max prefix sum as the difference of right minus
left:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\max_{(L, R)}: \sum_{L \leq i \leq R} a[i] \\
&= \max_R: \left(\sum_{0 \leq i \leq R} a[i] - min L: \sum_{0 \leq i \leq L \leq R} \right) \\
\end{align*}
$$

Which is then  expressed as: 
$$
asum[n] \equiv \sum_{0 \leq i \leq n} a[i] 
= \max_R: (asum[R] - min_{(L \leq R)}: asum[L])
$$

$$
aminsum[n] \equiv \min_{0 \leq i \leq n} asum[i] = \max_R: (asum[R] - aminsum[R])
$$

Since $asum$ is a prefix-sum of $a$, and $amin$ is a prefix min of
$asum$, the whole thing is $O(n)$ serial, $O(\log n)$ parallel.
In haskell, this translates to:

```hs
let sums = scanl (+) 0
let sums_mins = scanl1 min . sums
let rise xs = zipWith (-) (sums xs) (sums_mins xs)
main = rise [1, 2, 3, -2, -1, -4, 4, 6]
> [0,1,3,6,4,3,0,4,10]
```

`sums_mins` keeps track of the sea level, while the
`zipWith (-) xxx sums_mins` computes the elevation from the sea level.


# [Thoughts on implicit heaps](#thoughts-on-implicit-heaps)

Some musings I had on the ability to represent heaps as arrays, and in general,
the benifits of knowing the total number of elements.

- Knowing the total number of elements allows us to pre-ordain a memory layout.
  We can decide that for a node at index `i`, left child is at `2*i`, and
  right child is at `2*i+1`. This gives parent at `i//2`.

- This immediately gives us `O(1)` access to parent (`i//2`) and sibling `(i^1)`
  with no extra memory usage.                                                                                                                             S

- This cannot be done for data structures where we need to splice into
  the middle: For example, an implicit treap where we wish to splice sub-arrays
  together.

- On coding a heap, we can decide whether to use the left or right sibling by
  using `next = 2*i + predicate`. If `predicate = false = 0`, we will pick
  the left child, otherwise the right child. This allows us to compress
  some annoying if/then/elses into one-liners.

# [Discriminant and Resultant](#discriminant-and-resultant)

I had always seen the definition of a discriminant of a polynomial $p(x)$ as:
$$
Disc(p(x)) \equiv a_n^{(2n - n)} \prod_{i< j} (r_i - r_j)^2
$$

While it is clear _why_ this tracks if a polynomial has repeated roots
or not, I could never motivate to myself or remember this definition.

I learnt that in fact, this comes from a more general object, the **resultant**
of two polynomials $P(x), Q(x)$, which provides a new polynomial $Res(P(x), Q(x)$
which is zero iff $P, Q$ share a common root. Then, the discriminant is
defined as the resultant of a polynomial and its derivative. This makes far more
sense:

- If a polynomial has a repeated root $r$, then its factorization will
  be of the form $p(x) = (x - r)^2 q(x)$. The derivative of the polynomial 
  will have an $(x-r)$ term that can be factored out. 

- On the contrary, if a polynomial only has a root of degree 1, then the
  factorization will be $p(x) = (x - r) q(x)$, where $q(x)$ is not divisible by $(x-r)$.
  Then, the derivative will be $p'(x) = 1 \cdot q(x) + (x - r) q'(x)$. We cannot take $(x - r)$ common
   from this, since $q(x)$ is not divisible by $(x-r)$.

This cleared up a lot of the mystery for me.

### How did I run into this? Elimination theory.

I was trying to learn how elimination theory works: Given a variety
$V = \{ (x, y) : Z(x, y) = 0 \}$, how does one find a rational parametrization
$(p(t), q(t))$ such that  $Z(p(t), q(t)) = 0$, and $p(t), q(t)$ are
rational functions? That is, how do we find a rational parametrization of the
locus of a polynomial $Z(x, y)$? The answer is: use resultants! 

- We have two univariate polynomials $p(a; x), p(b; x)$, where the notation 
  $p(a; x)$ means that we have a polynomial $p(a; x) \equiv \sum_i a[i] x^i$.
  The resultant isa polynomial $Res(a; b)$ which is equal to $0$ when
  $p(a; x)$ and $p(b; x)$ share a common root.

- We can use this to eliminate variables. We can treat a bivariate polynomial $p(x, y)$
  as a univariate polynomial $p'(y)$ over the ring $R[X]$. This way, given two
  bivariate polynomial $p(a; x, y)$, $q(b; x, y)$, we can compute their resultant,
  giving us conditions to detect for which values of $a, b, x$, there exists
  a common $y$ such that $p(a; x, y)$ and $(q, x, y)$ share a root. If $(a, b)$
  are constants, then we get a polynomial $Res(x)$ that tracks whether $p(a; x, y)$
  and $q(a; x, y)$ share a root.

- We can treat the implicit equation above as two equations, $x - p(t) = 0$, 
  $y - q(t) = 0$. We can apply the method of resultants to project out $t$
  from the equations.

### 5 minute intro to elimination theory.

Recall that when we have a linear system $Ax = 0$, the system has a non-trivial
solution iff $|A| = 0$. Formally: $x \neq 0 \iff |A| = 0$. Also, the
ratio of solutions is given by:

$$x_i / x_j = (-1)^{i+j} |A_i|/|A_j|$$



If we have two polynomials $p(a; x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$, and
$q(b; x) = b_0 + b_1x + b_2 x^2$, then the system $p(a; x)$, $q(b; x)$ has
a simeltaneous zero iff:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\begin{bmatrix}
a_2 & a_1 & a_0 & 0 \\
0 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 \\
b_2 & b_1 & b_0 & 0\\
0 & b_2 & b_1 & b_0\\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}                                             
1 \\ x \\ x^2 \\ x^3
\end{bmatrix}
= 0 \\
&A x = 0
\end{align*}
$$

#### Big idea

The matrix is setup in such a way that any solution vector $v$ such that
$Qv = 0$ will be of the form $v = (\alpha^3, \alpha^2, \alpha, 1)$. That is,
the solution vector is a _polynomial_, such that $Qv = 0$. Since $Qv = 0$,
we have that $a_2 \alpha^2 + a_1 \alpha + a_0 = 0$, and $b_2 \alpha^2 + b_1 \alpha + b_0 = 0$.

#### Proof

- **Necessity** is clear. If we have some non trivial vector $v \neq 0$ such that
  $Qv = 0$, then we need $|Q| = 0$.

- **Sufficiency**: Since $|Q| = 0$, there is some vector $v = (w, x, y, z)$
  such that $Qv = 0$. 
  We need to show that this $v$ is non-trivial. If the polynomials $p(a;x)$,
  $q(b;x)$ are not equal, then we have that the rows which have coefficients
  from $p$ and $q$ are linearly independent. So, the pair of rows $(1, 3)$,
  and the pair $(2, 4)$ are linearly independent. This means that
  the linear system:

$$
a_2 w + a_1 x + a_0 y = 0 \\
b_2 w + a_1 x + a_0 y = 0 \\
$$

Similarly:

$$
a_2 x + a_1 y + a_0 z = 0 \\
b_2 x + a_1 y + a_0 z = 0 \\
$$

Since the coefficients of the two systems are the same, we must have that
$(w, x, y)$ and $(x, y, z)$ are linearly dependent. That is:

$$
(w, x, y) = \alpha (x, y, z) \\
w = \alpha x = \alpha^2 y = \alpha^3 z \\
$$

We can take $z = 1$ arbitrarily, giving us a vector of the form
$(w, x, y, z) = (\alpha^3, \alpha^2, \alpha, 1)$, which is the structure
of the solution we are looking for!

### Measures of error

If $x$ is a number and $\hat x$ is its approximation, then the are two notions of
error:
1. absolute errror: $|x - \hat x|$.
2. relative error: $|x - \hat x|/|x|$. 

Since the relative error is invariant under scaling $(x \mapsto \alpha x)$, we
will mostly be interested in relative error.


### Significant digits

The significant digits in a number are the first nonzero digit and all
succeeding digits. Thus `1.7320` has five significant digits. `0.0491` has
only three significant digits.
**It is not transparent to me why this definition is sensible**.

### Correct Significant digits --- a first stab

We can naively define $\hat x$ agrees to $x$ upto $p$ significant digits
if $\hat x$ and $x$ round to the same number upto $p$ significant digits.
This definition is seriously problematic. Consider the numbers:

- $x = 0.9949$, $x_1 = 1.0$, $x_2 = 0.99$, $x_3 = 0.9950$
- $y = 0.9951$, $y_1 = 1.0$, $y_2 = 1.0$, $y_3 = 0.9950$

Here, $y$ has correct one and three significant digits relative to $x$,
but incorrect 2 significant digits, since the truncation at $x_2$ and $y_2$ 
do not agree even to the first significant digit.

### Correct Significant digits --- the correct definition

We say that $\hat x$ agress to $x$ upto $p$ significant digits if $|x - \hat x|$
is less than half a unit in the pth significant digit of $x$.

### Accuracy v/s precision

- Accuracy: absolute or relative error of a quantity.
- Precision: accuracy with which basic arithmetic `+, -, *, /` are performed.
  for floating point, measured by unit round-off (we have not met this yet).


**Accuracy is not limited by precision**: By using fixed precision arithmetic,
we can emulate arbitrary precision arithmetic. The problem is that often
this emulation is too expensive to be useful.

### Backward, Forward errors

Let $y = f(x)$, where $f: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$. Let us compute $\hat y$ as an approximation to 
$y$, in an arithmetic of precision $u$. How do we measure the quality of $\hat y$?

1. In many cases, we maybe happy with an $\hat y$ such that the relative error between
   $y$ and $\hat y$ is equal to $u$: we did the best we can with the precision
   that was given. This is the **forward error**. 
2. An alternative question we can ask is, for what $\delta x$ do we have that 
   $\hat y = f(x + \delta x)$. That is, how far away from the input do we 
   need to stray, to get a matching output? There maybe many such $\delta x$,
   so we ask for $\min |\delta x|$. We can divide this error by $x$ as a 
   normalization factor. This is the **backward error**.

<img width=800 src="./static/forward-backward-error.png">

There are two reasons we prefer backward error.

1. It converts error analysis into "data analysis". The data itself tends
   to be uncertain. If the error given by the backward analysis is smaller
   than the data uncertainty, then we can write off our error as being
   too small. Since for all we know, we have 'fixed' the uncertain data
   with our small error.
2. It reduces the question of error analysis into perturbation theory,
   which is very well understood for a large class of problems.

### Backward stable

A method for computing $y = f(x)$ is called **backward stable**
if it produces a $\hat y$ with small backward error. That is, we need a 
small $\delta x$ such that $\hat y = f(x + \delta x)$.

### Mixed forward-backward error

We assume that addition and subtraction are backward stable, where $u$
is the number of significant digits to which our arithmetic operations
can be performed:

$$
x \pm y = x(1 + \Delta) \pm y(1 + \Delta) \forall |\Delta| \leq u
$$

Another type of error we can consider is that of the form:

$$                                                                              
\hat y + \delta y = f(x + \Delta x)
$$

That is, for a small perturbation in the output $(\delta y)$, we can get a
backward error of $\delta x$. This is called as **mixed forward backward error**.

<img width=800 src="./static/mixed-forward-backward-error.png">

We can say that an algorithm with mixed-forward-backward-error is stable iff:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\hat y + \delta y = f(x + \Delta x) \\
&|\Delta y|/|\hat y| < \epsilon \\
&|\Delta x|/|\hat x| < \eta \\
&\text{$\epsilon, \eta$ are small}
\end{align*}
$$

This definition of stability is useful when rounding errors are the dominant
form of errors.

### Conditioning

Relationship between forward and backward error is govered by _conditioning_:
the sensitivity of solutions to perturbations of data. Let us have an approximate
solution $\hat y = f(x + \delta x)$. Then:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\hat y - y = f(x + \delta x) - f(x) = f'(x) \delta x + O((\delta x)^2) \\
&(\hat y - y)/y = (x f'(x)/f(x)) (\Delta x/x) + O((\Delta x)^2) \\
&(\hat y - y)/y = c(x) (\Delta x/x) + O((\Delta x)^2)\\
&c(x) \equiv |x f'(x)/f(x)|
\end{align*}
$$

The quantity $c(x)$ measures the scaling factor to go from the relative
change in output to the relative change in input. Note that this is a property
of the function $f$, not any particular algorithm.

##### Example: $\log x$

If $f(x) = \log x$, then $c(x) = |(x (\log x)') / \log x| = |1/\log x|$. This
quantity is very large for $x \simeq 1$. So, a small change in $x$ can 
produce a drastic change in $\log x$ around $1$.

- Note the the _absolute_ change is quite small: $\log(x + \delta x) \simeq \log x + \delta x/x$.
  However, relative to $\log x$, this change of $\delta x/x$ is quite large.

##### Rule of thumb

We now gain access to the useful rule:

$$
\text{forward error} \lesssim \text{condition number} \times \text{backward error}
$$

- Glass half empty: Ill-conditioned problems can have large forward error.
- Glass half full: Well-conditioned problems do not amplify error in data.

### Forward stable

If a method produces answers with forward errors of similar magnitude to those
produced by a backward stable method, then it is called forward stable. 
**Backward stability implies forward stability, but not vice-versa** (TODO: why?)

### Cancellation

Consider the following program:

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double x = 12e-9;
    double c = cos(x);
    double one_sub_c = 1 - c;
    double denom = x*x;
    double yhat = one_sub_c / denom;

    printf("x:         %20.16f\n"
           "cx:        %20.16f\n"
           "one_sub_c: %20.16f\n"
           "denom:     %20.16f\n"
           "yhat:      %20.16f\n",
            x, c, one_sub_c, denom, yhat); 
}
```

which produces the output:

```
x:           0.0000000120000000
cx:          0.9999999999999999
one_sub_c:   0.0000000000000001
denom:       0.0000000000000001
yhat:        0.7709882115452477
```

This is __clearly wrong__, because we know that $(1-\cos x)/x^2) \leq 1/2$.
The reason for this terrible result is that:
- we know $\cos x$ to high accuracy, since $x$ was some fixed quantity.
- $1 - \cos x$ converted the **error** in $\cos x$ into its **value**.
- $1 - \cos x$ has only one significant figure.
- This makes it practically useless for anything else we are interested in doing.

In general:

$$
\begin{align*}
&x \equiv 1 + \epsilon \text{error of order $\epsilon$} \\
&y \equiv 1 - x = \epsilon \text{value of order $\epsilon$} \\
\end{align*}
$$

That is, subtracting values close to each other (in this case, $1$ and $x$)
converts **error order of magnitude** into **value order of magnitude**. 
Alternatively, it brings earlier errors into promience as values.

### Analysis of subtraction

We can consider the subtraction:

$$
\begin{align*}
&x = a - b; \hat x = \hat a - \hat b \\
&\hat a = a(1 + \Delta a) \\
&\hat b = b(1 + \Delta b) \\
&\left| \frac{x - \hat x}{x} \right|  \\
&= \left| \frac{-a\Delta a - b\Delta b}{a - b} \right| \\
&= \frac{|-a\Delta a - b\Delta b|}{|a - b|} \\
&=  \frac{|a\Delta a + b\Delta b|}{|a - b|} \\
&\leq  \frac{\max(|\Delta a|, |\Delta b|) (|a| + |b|)}{|a - b|}
\end{align*}
$$

This quantity will be large when $|a - b| \ll |a| + |b|$: that is, when
there is heavy cancellation in the subtraction to compute $x$. 

### Underflow

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double x = 1000;
    for(int i = 0; i < 60; ++i) {
        x = sqrt(x);
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < 60; ++i) {
        x = x*x;
    }
    printf("x: %10.20f\n", x);
}
```

This produces the output:

```
./sqrt-pow-1-12
...
x: 1.00000000000000000000
```

That is, even though the function is an identity function, the answer collapses
to `1`. What is happening?

### Computing $(e^x - 1)/x$
One way to evaluate this function is as follows:

```cpp 
double f(double x) { return x == 0 ? 1 : (pow(M_E, x) - 1) / x; }
```

This can suffer from catastrophic cancellation in the numerator. When
$x$ is close to $0$, $e^x$ is close to 1, and $e^x - 1$ will magnify the
error in $e^x$.

```cpp
double f(double x) { 
   const double y = pow(M_E, x);
   return y == 1 ? 1 : (y - 1) / log(y);
}
```

This algorithm seems crazy, but there's insight in it. We can show that
the errors cancel! The idea is that neither $(y - 1)$ nor $\log y$ are
particularly good, the errors accumulated in them almost completely
cancel out, leaving out a good value:

$$
\text{assume $\hat y = 1$} \\
1 = \hat y \equiv e^x(1 + \delta) \\
\log 1 = \log (e^x ) + \log(1 + \delta) \\
x = -\log(1 + \delta) \\
x = -\delta + O(\delta^2)
$$

If $\hat y \neq 1$:

$$
\hat f = (\hat y - 1)/\log{\hat y} = (1+\epsilon_3)(\hat y - 1)(1 + \epsilon+1)/(\log \hat y(1 + \epsilon_2))
$$

We have two types of zeroes, `+0` and `-0` in IEEE-754. These are used in some
cases. The most famous is that $1/+0 = +\infty$, while $1/-0 = -\infty$. Here,
we proceed to discuss some complex-analytic considerations.

$$
\sqrt{-1 + 0 i} = +0 + i \\
\sqrt{-1 - 0 i} = +0 - i \\
$$
These will ensure that $\sqrt{z*} = (\sqrt{z})*$:


$$
\texttt{copysign}(1, +0) = +1 \\
\texttt{copysign}(1, -0) = -1 \\
$$

These will ensure that $\copysign{x, 1/x} = x$ when $x = \pm \infty$.


An example is provided where the two limits:

$$
\begin{align*}
&f(x + i0) = \lim_{y \rightarrow 0-} f(x + i y) \\
&f(x + i0) = \lim_{y \rightarrow 0-} f(x + i y) \\
\end{align*}
$$

#### Complex-analytic considerations

The principal branch of a complex function is a way to select one branch
of a complex-function, which tends to be multi-valued. A classical example
is the argument function, where $\arg(r e^{i \theta} = \theta$. 
However, this is ambiguous: we can map $\theta \mapsto \theta + 2 \pi$
and still have the same complex number. So, we need to fix some standard.
We usually pick the "branch" where $0 \leq \theta < 2 \pi$.
In general, we need to carefully handle what happens to the function at
the discontinuity.

# [Mobius inversion on Incidence Algebras](#mobius-inversion-on-incidence-algebras)

Most of these functions are really defined on the _incidence algebra_ of
the poset $P$ with ground field $K$. An _incidence_ algebra $I(P)$ is a
set of functions which maps intervals of $P$ to the ground field $K$. an
interval is a tuple $(x, y) \in P \times P$ such that $x \leq P$
(where the $\leq$ comes from the partial order on $P$). We have a product
structure which I denote $\star$, given by:

$$
(\alpha \star \beta)([x, z]) = \sum_{x \leq y \leq z} \alpha(x, y) \beta(y, z)
$$

A linear algebra way to look at this is to consider $|P| x |P|$ matrices over $K$
where the rows and columns are indexed by $P$.
The a function $\alpha: P \times P \rightarrow K$
can be written as the elements of the $P \times P$ matrix.
Then this convolution-like operator $\star$ is simply matrix multiplication.

We have three natural functions: 

(1) The characteristic function, which is the identity for $\star$:

$$
\delta([x, z]) \equiv 1 \texttt{ if } x = z \texttt{; } 0 \texttt{ otherwise }
$$


(2) the zeta function, which plays the role of the constant $1$:

$$
\zeta([x, z]) \equiv  1 \texttt{ if } x \leq z \texttt{; } 0 \texttt{ otherwise }
$$

(3) The inverse of the zeta function, the mobius function, a tool for mobius inversion:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\mu([x, z])  = 1 \\
&\mu([x, z])  = - \sum_{x \leq y < z} \mu([x, y]) \\
\end{align*}
$$


The mobius inversion theorem for posets states that $\zeta$ and $\mu$ as
defined above are convolutional inverses. that is, $\zeta \star \mu = \delta$.

This allows us to prove:

$$
\begin{align*}
&g([x, z]) = \sum_{x \leq y \leq z} f([x, y]) \\
&g([x, z]) = \sum_{x \leq y \leq z} f([x, y]) \cdot 1 \\
&g([x, z]) = \sum_{x \leq y \leq z} f([x, y]) \cdot \zeta(y, z) \\
&g = f \star \zeta \\
&g \star mu = f \star \zeta \star \mu \\
&g \star mu = f \star \delta \\
&g \star mu = f
\end{align*}
$$

We have managed to find $f$ in terms of $g$, when previously we had $g$
in terms of $f$. 


**TODO**: we are usually interested in a _fixed_ $[x, z]$. What happens if we 
make this implicit? We may get nice notation for all of this!

### Sums as mobius inversion

We can derive the formula we had for integrals, that:

$$
F(i) = \sum_{0 \leq i \leq n} f(i) \iff f(k) = F(k) - F(k-1)
$$

by setting up mobius inversion on the usual partial order for the natural
numbers. For simplicity, I'll show the example on $[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]$. The example
immediately generalizes.

- We have the partial (well, total) order $P$: $0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < 4$. 
- We are given a function $f(\cdot)$ we wish to integrate. We define an
  auxiliary function $fi([x, y]) = f(y)$ which evaluates $f$ on the right
  endpoint.
- We can now define $F([x, z])$  as the sum of $f$ from $x$ to $z$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&F([x, z]) \equiv \sum_{x \leq y \leq z} f(y) \\
&= \sum_{x \leq y \leq z} fi([x, y]) \\
&= \sum_{x \leq y \leq z} fi([x, y]) \cdot \zeta(y, z) \\
&= fi \star \zeta
\end{align*}
$$

- This tells us that $f(n) = fi([0, n]) = (F \star \mu)([0, n])$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&f(n) = fi([0, n]) \equiv  (F \star mu)[0, n] \\
&=  \sum_{0 \leq x \leq n} F([0, x]) \mu([x, n])
\end{align*}
$$

- We note that we need to know the values of $\mu([x, n])$ for a _fixed_ n,
  for _varying_ x. Let us attempt to calculate $\mu([0, 4]), \mu([1, 4]), \mu([2, 4]), \mu([3, 4]), \mu([4, 4])$
  and see if this can be generalized:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mu([4, 4]) = 1 \text{ By definition}
\mu([3, 4]) = - \left (\sum_{3 \leq x < 4} \right) \text{ By definition }
\end{align*}
$$
# [Finite differences and Umbral calculus](#finite-differences-and-umbral-calculus)

Umbral calculus lays out a large collection of "umbral" / "shadowy"
coincidences across combinatorics and calculus. Here, I'll lay out some of
these that I learnt from [Concrete Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Mathematics).
I hope to use this for myself to motivate a bunch of combinatorics. I'll
provide an interesting proof of why $\sum{1 \leq k < n} k^2 = k(k-1)/2$
using this umbral calculus.

### Discrete Derivative: Forward difference

We begin by trying to build a discrete version of the derivative operator. The
derivative of `f` will be denoted using `f'`. The _forward_ difference
of $f: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R$ is defined as:

$$
\delta f: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R; (\delta f)(x) = f(x + 1) - f(x)
$$

Immediately, we can see that this operator is linear:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\delta(f + g) 
  &= (f+g)(x+1) - (f+g)(x)  \\
  &= (f(x+1) - f(x)) + (g(x+1)-g(x))  \\
  &= (\delta f) + (\delta g)  \\
&\delta(\alpha f)(x) 
  &= (\alpha f)(x+1) - (\alpha f)(x) \\
  &= \alpha \cdot (f(x+1) - f(x))   \\
  &= \alpha (\delta f)
\end{align*}
$$

it obeys a slightly corrupted version of the chain rule, $(fg)' = f' g + g' f$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\delta(fg)  \\
  &= (fg)(x+1) - (fg)(x)  \\
  &= f(x+1)g(x+1) - f(x)g(x) + 0 \\
  &= f(x+1)g(x+1) - f(x)g(x) + [f(x)g(x+1) - f(x)g(x+1)] \\
  &= g(x+1)[f(x+1) - f(x)] + f(x)[g(x+1) - g(x)] \\
  &= g(x+1)(\delta f)(x) + f(x) (\delta g)(x) \\
  &= (S \delta f)(x) + (f \delta g)(x) [(Sh)(x) \equiv h(x+1)] \\
  &= (S  \delta f + f \delta g)(x) \\
\end{align*}
$$

We need this new $S$ operator to shift the function's input from $x$ to $x+1$.

### Falling factorial as polynomials

cool, now that we seem to have a linear derivative operator that behaves
roughly sanely, let's test it out! The first reasonable target is a polynomial,
so let's try $x^2$:

$$
\delta(x^2) = (x+1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1
$$

This is disappointing, it does not behave very well `:(` However, there _is_
an analogue that does well. This is the _falling factorial_, defined as:

$$
x^{(n)} \equiv x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-n+1)
$$

For example:

$$
x^{(0)} = 1 \\
x^{(1)} = x \\
x^{(2)} = x(x-1) \\
x^{(3)} = x(x-1)(x-2) \\
$$

Let's try and apply our discrete difference $\delta$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\delta(x^{(2)})  \\
  & = (x+1)(x-1+1) - x(x-1) \\
  & = (x+1)(x) - x(x-1) \\
  & = x*2 = 2x(1) \\
&\delta(x^{(3)})  \\
  &= (x+1)(x-1+1)(x-2+1) - x(x-1)(x-2) \\
  &= (x+1)(x)(x-1) - x(x-1)(x-2) \\ 
  &= x(x-1)((x+1) - (x-2)) = 3x(x-1) = 3x^{(2)} \\
\end{align*}
$$

These falling factorials look pretty unnatural though, why do we care?
Well, once we build some integral calculus, we can handle our problem
of $\sum_{1 \leq i < k} i^2$ using this calculus, by rewriting $i^2$
in terms of these falling factorials.

### Sums as discrete integrals

We want to think of $\sum_{0 \leq i < n} f(i)$ as the correct variant of
$\int_0^n f(i) di$. The most important property of an integral is
the fundamental theorem of calculus:

$$
\int_a^b f'(i) di = f(b) - f(a) \mapsto \sum_{a \leq i < b} (\delta f)(i) =?= f(b) - f(a)
$$

we can check if the assertion is true:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\sum_{a \leq i < b} (\delta f)(i)  \\
&= [f(a+1) - f(a)] + [f(a+2) - f(a+1)] + [f(a+3)-f(a+2)] + \cdots + [f(b) - f(b-1)] \\
&= f(b) - f(a) \quad \text{(The sum telescopes)} 
\end{align*}
$$

Sweet, so we just kicked a theory of calculus of the ground. Let's put
this to some use:

### Gauss' famous formula from discrete calculus

Let's begin by deriving the closed form for $[1\cdot(k-1)]$ naturals:
                                                
$$
\sum_{0 \leq i < n} i = \sum_{0 \leq i < n} i^{(1)} = i^{(2)}/2 \big|_{0}^n = n(n-1)/2
$$

Let's now derive the closed form form the sum of squares of $[1\cdot(k-1)]$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\sum_{0 \leq i < n} i^2  \\
&= \sum_{0 \leq i < n} i*(i-1) + i  \\
&= \sum_{0 \leq i < n} i^{(2)} + i^{(1)} \\
&= n^{(3)}/2 + n^{(2)}/2 \\
&= n(n-1)(n-2)/3 + n(n-1)/2 \\
&= n(n-1)(n/3 - 2/3 + 1/2) \\
&= n(n-1)(2n - 1)/6 \\
\end{align*}
$$

Trying to perform this process in general does beg a question: how do we
convert from $x^n$ into some combination of rising and falling factorials?
It turns out that _Stirling Numbers_ will show up to aid this conversion.
But before that, let's see some more connections.

### $2^x$ as the combinatorial version of $e^x$

We want to find the analogue of the exponential function $e^x$, which
satisfies the equation $f'(x) = f(x)$. Setting this up in the discrete case:

$$
\begin{align*}
&d'f(x) = f(x) |  f(0) = 1 \\
&f(x+1) - f(x) = f(x) | f(0) = 1 \\
&f(x+1) = 2f(x) | f(0) = 1 \\
&f(n) = 2^n
\end{align*}
$$

What does this buy us? It gives us a nice proof that $\sum_{k} nCk = 2^n$.
It proceeds by taking the taylor of $e^x$, "combinatorializing it", and then
simplifying:

$$
\begin{align*}
&e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!} \\
&2^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^{(n)}}{n!} \\
&     = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x*(x-1)*(x-2)*\cdots(x-n+1)}{n!} \\
&     = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x*(x-1)*(x-2)*\cdots(x-n+1)}{n!}
\end{align*}
$$

### Harmonic series as the combinatorial version of logarithm

In the continuous case, we have that $\integral 1/x = \log x$. In the
discrete case, we get $\sum_{i=1}^n 1/x \equiv H_n$, the sum of the
first $n$ harmonic numbers. This explains _why_ the harmonic numbers
keep showing up in different places across discrete math --- We're often
trying to integrate some kind of $1/x$ quantity.
This also may tell us that $H_n$ and $2^n$ are somewhat "weak inverses" of each other. 
I haven't thought about this weak inverse thing too much.

### Stirling numbers of the first kind for convering between polynomials and falling factorials

We can express $x^{(n)} = \sum_{k=0}^n [n, k] x^k$ where $[n, k]$ 
are the (yet to be defined) unsigned stirling numbers of the first kind. 
(aside: I wonder if this can be derived from some kind of mobius inversion).

We begin my in fact _defining_ the stirling numbers of the first kind, $[n, k]$
as the coefficients of the rising factorial:

$$
x^{(n)} = x(x+1)(x+2) \dots (x+n-1) = \sum_{i=0}^n [n, i] x^i
$$

The question as a combinatorialist is:

> what do the unsigned striling numbers of the first kind, $[n, i]$, count?

The answer is:

> $[n, i]$ counts the number of permutations of $n$ elements with $i$
> disjoint cycles.

For example, in the case of the permutations of the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$, 
we have the permutations:

$$
\begin{align*}
(1)(2)(3) \text{3 cycles} \\
(12)(3) \text{2 cycles} \\
(1)(23) \text{2 cycles} \\
(2)(13) \text{2 cycles} \\
(132) \text{1 cycle} \\
(123) \text{1 cycle} \\
\end{align*}
$$

So, this gives the counts:

$$
[3, 3] = 1
[3, 2] = 3
[3, 1] = 2
$$

These stirling numbers satisfy a recurrence:

$$
[n+1, k] = n[n, k] + [n, k-1]
$$

This can be seen combinatorially. If we want the number permutations of $n+1$ objects
with $k$ cycles, we can either:

1. Take the permutations of $n$ objects with $k-1$ cycles, $[n, k-1]$, and then
   insert the new $(n+1)$th object into a new cycle all by itself. That is,
   we create a new permutation where $p(n+1) = (n+1)$.
2. Take the permutation of $n$ objects with $k$ cycles, and insert this new $(n+1)$th
   object into any of the $k$ cycles. If the original permutation had `x -p-> y`,
   we can insert this new object as `x -p-> * -p->y` for any `x`. Thus, there are
   $n$ choices of locations to inser `*` --- as the image of all possible `x`s.
   This gives us the $n[n, k]$ term.

Another cute fact of the unsigned stirling numbers of the first kind $[n, k]$
is that since permutations are partitioned by their number of cycles, we have:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^n [n, k] = n!
$$

# [Permutahedron](#permutahedron)

The permutahedron over $n$ letters is a polytope which is defined as the convex
hull of all permutations of the point $(1, 2, \dots, n)$. 
For example, the permutahedron over 3 letters is the convex hull of the
points $(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)$.


Here, we show that it can be embedded in $(d-1)$ dimensionl space, and that each point
$perm((1, 2, \dots n))$ is indeed a vertex of the convex hull. 

An example of a situation where a point is _not_ in the vertex of a convex hull
is `convexhull(1, 2, 3) = [1, 3]`. Note that `2` was used to generate the
convex hull, but is not a vertex since it is the convex combination of `1, 3`.
We wish to prove that such a situation does not happen in the case of the
permutahedron.

I have not seen an elementary proof that each point that is a permutation of
the original is a vertex, so I'm recording that proof out of interest.


### Showing that all permutations of $(1, 2, \dots, n)$ are vertices

#### Core idea

start by looking at index `i` of the "largest value" `N` in the point `P`.
Since it's the largest point, if it's a convex combination, all other points in
the convex combination must have the same "largest value" at that index `i`. So
we can now ignore the index `i` and get permutations of `[1..N-1]`

Repeat this process to prove that _all_ indexes of things in the convex sum
must be equal to `P`. But this is absurd, because all vertices are distinct.
Hence, the only way for this to work out is if we have only one point that we
are convex-summing over. That is, `P` _cannot_ be written as the convex sum of
two or more vertices.

#### Formal proof


Let us be working with permutations of `[1, 2, ..., N]`. Pick point `P`. Assume
`P` is in the convex sum of some `{ Xi }`.

Let `index(N, P)` be the index of number `N` in `P`. For example, if 
`P = [2, 3, 1]`, then 

```
index(2, P) = 0 (assuming 0-based indexing)
index(3, P) = 1
index(1, P) = 2
```

If `P` is the convex sum of vertices `{ Xi }`, all of them _must_ have that:

```
Xi[index(N, P)]  = N forall Xi in the convex sum
```


since `N` is the largest value that `X_I` can have at any index. The only way
to get the maximum value by a convex sum is for all values to be that maximum
value.

So, we can now ignore dimension `index(N, P)`, since _all the vertices_ `X_i`
involved in the convex combination and `P` have `index(N, P) = N`. If we
project out this dimension, we are left with permutation of `(1..N-1)`. 

Repeat the same process. We will need to have all `X_i` to have their value at
`index(N-1, P)` to be `N-1`. 

Keep doing this till we get that the dimensions of all points in `Xi` and `P`
are equal. But all the points in `{ Xi }` are distinct since they are
permutation of `[1..n]`. Hence, `{ Xi }` can contain only a single point, and
this point is `P`.

Hence, `P` cannot be written as the convex combination of other points. Hence,
`P` is a vertex.

#### Proof that convex sum of maximum must have maximum

Assume we have values `{v1, v2, ... vn}` where without loss of generality,
`v1 <= v2 <= ... <= vn`. We can always relabel otherwise.

Now we want to write `vn` as the convex sum of `{v1, v2, ... vn}`. We can draw this on
the number line as:

```
---[v1--v2--v3--...--vn]---
```

- A convex sum must be inside this line segment between `[v1--...--vn]` (`vn` is
  to the rightmost since it's known to be the largest value in `{v1...vn}`).
- So, if we try to write `vn` as the convex sum, we _must_ have the coefficient
  of `vn=1` and the coefficient of all other points `=0`, since any other
  combination will "pull the convex sum away from the right (where `vn` sits),
  towards the left".

# [Lyndon + Christoffel = Convex Hull](#lyndon-christoffel-convex-hull)
Actual "real world" use-case of lyndon factorization, cribbed from here:

- [Lyndon + Christoffel = digitally convex](https://archipel.uqam.ca/8354/1/Reutenauer-2009a-preprint.pdf)
- Combinatorics on Words: Christoffel Words and Repetitions in Words

I wanted to learn a real-world use-case of lyndon factorization so I could
remember it. I found a whole bridge between combinatorics/strings and
discrete geometry (they call it "digital geometry") that I didn't know
existed before.


- If you have a line with rational slope $p/q$ and you want to draw a
  "discretized line" by connecting integer points in ZxZ, you can describe this
  discretized line as starting from $(0, 0)$, making moves $x$ (move up 1 unit
  along $x$-axis), $y$ (move up 1 unit along $y$-axis), finally reaching the point 
  $(p, q)$. For example, to reach the point $(2, 3)$, you can make the moves 
  $[x, x, x, y, y]$.

- A christoffel word is a word $w \in \{x, y \}^\star$ such that it hugs a line of
  rational slope $p/q$ as close as possible. Formally, there are no integer
  points between the line with slope $p/q$ starting from the origin, and the
  discretized line as described by $w$. An example picture:

<img src="./static/christoffel-word-example.png">

- It turns out that all primitive christoffel words are Lyndon words. I'm not
  100% sure what primitive is, but the take-away is that these primitive
  christoffel words represent discrete lines that are *good* approximations
  of lines.

- Now, we are given a discrete sequence of adjacent line segments going
  upwards, where the line segments are described by $x, y$ moves. We want to
  check if the discrete curve defined by them is well-approximating a convex
  polygon.

- We compute the lyndon factorization of the word. This splits the
  original line segment into a series of line segments, where each
  successive line segment has lower slope than the previous (since the
  lyndon decomposition splits words into non-decreasing lex order).

<img src="./static/lyndon-convex.png">

- We can then check that each word in the lyndon decomposition is a Christoffel
  word. If it is, then your sequence of moves describes a "good  discrete
  convex hull", since as described above, a christoffel word "hugs the line"
  well. 


### Bonus: slick characterization of line drawing

<img src="./static/christoffel-cyclic-7-4.png">


If we want to draw a line with slope `p/q = 4/7` using the lower approximation the idea
is that we keep taking `4` steps along `x`, and every time we "exceed" `7` steps
along `x`, we take a step along `y`.

This is the same as:
1. working in `Z/(4+7)Z`, starting from `0`, writing down multiples of `4` till we cycle back to `0`
2. marking an "increase" in a step with an `x`, and a "decrease" in a step
  with `y`.

The intuition is that once we walk `k*p` steps where `k*p >= q`, we want
to increment `y`. So, at first glance, we may believe we should consider
`Z/qZ`. However, this is misguided. Examples to enlighten:


1. Consider `x=1, y=0`. We should use `Z/1Z = { 0 }`: that is, we must keep
  moving along `0 -x -> 0 -x-> 0 -x-> ...`. This is unlike what happens if we choose
  `Z/0Z` (which is not a well-defined idea).
2. Consider `x=1,y=1`. We should use `Z/2Z`, so we keep going `0 -x-> 1 -y-> 0 -> ...`
  which will cause is to flip `x -> y -> x -> y -> ...`. 


In some sense, we are making sure that we can "start" with an `x` and see where that takes us.
In the `Z/1Z` case, we realise that we can keep taking `x`s. In the
`Z/2Z` case, we realise we need to flip between `x` and `x`.

Let's try to show this formally, where `k` is the smallest number
such that `kp >= q`. We'll also have concrete examples where
`p=2, q=7`. For the example, `k=4` since `kp = 4*2 = 8 > 7`. 
If we work in `Z/yZ = Z/7Z`, we will get the numbers:


```
Z:    0, p, 2p, ... (k-1)p, [q] kp 
Z/qZ: 0, p, 2p, ... (k-1)p, [q] (kp % q)
Z/7z: 0, 2,  4, ...      6, [7] (8 % 7 = 1)
```

But notice that we are inserting `x` _between_ numbers. So we will get:

```
Z:    0 -x-> p -x-> 2p, ... (k-1)p -y-> (k+1)p
Z/qZ: 0 -x-> p -x-> 2p, ... (k-1)p -y-> ((k+1)p % y)
Z/7z: 0 -x-> 2 -x->  4, ...      6 -y-> (8      % 7 = 1) 
         ^                            ^
      x since [0 < 2]              y since [6 > 1]
```

which gives us the moves:

```
Z/7Z: 0 -x-> 2 -x-> 4 -x-> 6 -y-> 8 % 7 = 1
```

We only get `3` occurences of `x`, after which on the next accumulation of `p`,
becomes an `8` which wraps around to a `1`. This is the age-old tension that exists
between **points** and **gaps**. For `k` points, there are `k-1` gaps. In our
case, we have `4` points `[0, 2, 4, 6]`, but this leaves us room for only
three gaps for three`x` moves, while in reality we need `4`.
We remedy this situation by giving ourselves space enough for _one_ more `x`, by changing from `Z/qZ`
to `Z/(p+q)Z`. We should look at this as creating space for another gap.


```
Z:        0, p, 2p, ... (k-1)p, [q] kp,  [q+p  ], (k+1)p
Z/(p+q)Z: 0, p, 2p, ... (k-1)p, [q] kp,  [q+p  ], (k+1)p % (p+q)    
Z/9z: 0, 2,  4, ...          6, [7]  8,  [7+2=9], (10    %    9=1)
```

which gives us the moves:

```
Z:        0 -x-> p -x-> ... (k-1)p -x-> kp -y-> (k+1)p
Z/(p+q)Z: 0 -x-> p -x-> ... (k-1)p -x-> kp -y-> (k+1)p % (p+q)
Z/9Z:     0 -x-> 2 -x-> ...      6 -x->  8 -y-> (   10 %     9 = 1)
             ^                             ^
           x since [0 < 2]               y since [8 > 1]

```

That is, we are able to get `k` occurences `x` between `0, p, ..,kp` which
has `(k+1)` points. Concretely, we have:

```
Z/9Z: 0 -x-> 2 -x-> 4 -x-> 6 -x-> 8 -y-> 1
```
where we have 4 occurences of `x` in between after which we have an occurence
of `y`, which is what we want when `x=2, y = 7`. We need to reach at least
`q=7` before we have exceeded our denominator and need to make a move
along `y`.


# [Geometric proof of `e^x >= 1+x`, `e^(-x) >= 1-x`](#e-x-1-xof-of-)

Let's concentrate on the `e^x >= 1 + x` part. 

1. The tangent of `e^x` at `x = 0` is `1 + x`, since the taylor series
   of `e^x` truncated upto `x` is `1 + x`.
2. `e^x` is a strongly convex function, since `(e^x)'' = e^x` which is positive
   everywhere. Hence, `e^x` will always lie above its tangent.

Similarly for `e^(-x)`, working through the math:

1. `1 -x` is tangent at `x=0` to `e^(-x)`
2. `(e^(-x))'' = -(e^(-x))' e^(-x)` which is again positive everywhere, and
   hence, `e^(-x)` is strongly convex.




# [Ranking and Sorting](#ranking-and-sorting)

We we want to sort an arrray `xs` and write the results into an array `ys`.
In both cases, the invariant to be satisfied is that `ys` is `xs` in ascending
order. I'll be considering two broad ways to implement such a thing:


- 1. **(RANK)** Index straight into `ys`, reindexed into `xs`. We name the reindexing
  array as `rs` (`rs` for _ranks_).

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
   ys[rs[i]] = xs[i]
}
```

- 2. **(SELECT)** Reindex into `ys`, index straight into `xs`. 
  We name the reindexing array `ss` (`ss` for _selects_).

```cpp
for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
   ys[i] = xs[ss[i]]
}
```

#### Defnition of rank

In the case of **(RANK)**, the specification is that the rank of an element `e`
is the number of elements that are:

1. less than `e`.
2. equal to `e` but occur before `e`.

This ensures that rank is a _permutation_: that is, every element `e` is given
a _unique_ index. 

```cpp
int rank(const int *xs, int i) { 
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < N; ++j) {
        if (xs[j] < xs[i] || (xs[j] == xs[i] && j < i)) cnt += 1;
    }
    return cnt;
}

for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
  rs[i] = rank(xs, i);
}
```

##### Rank: Alternative 1
An alternative way to look at our definition of rank is that we are
sorting the tuples  `(xs[i], i)` using lex ordering. So if two indeces
`i, j` have the same value, then we sort on the index.


##### Rank: Alternative 2
We could have also defined rank as:

```cpp
int rank(int *xs, int i) { 
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
        if (xs[j] <= xs[i]) cnt += 1
    }
    return cnt;
}
```

I declined from doing so because I wanted to show the lex-ordering
interpretation of `rank` will be be useful later.

#### Definition of select

For **(SELECT)**, we'll need to think a little harder. Let's try to rewrite
our way to glory:

- 1. From definition of rank:

```cpp
ys[rs[i]] = xs[i]
```

- 2. move `i -> ss[i]` where `ss[i]` is guaranteed to be a permutation,
  so we will write each index eventually:

```cpp
ys[rs[ss[i]]] = xs[ss[i]]
```

- 3. Stipulate that `rs[ss[i]] = i`, since we want a `ys[i]`:

```cpp
ys[i] = xs[ss[i]]
```

This gives us necessary and sufficient conditions on how to find an `ss`:
`ss` must be a permutation that is an inverse permutation to `rs`.


#### How to invert a permutation?

How does one invert a permutation? We have a permutation `rs[i]` that maps
`i` to `rs[i]`. We want to find a new permutation `ss[i]` such that 

```
rs[ss[i]] = i
```

Equivalently:

```
// ss[i] is an index 'k'...
ss[i] = k 
// 'k' is the location of 'i' in rs.
rs[k] = i
```

So if we first tag each location of `rs` with its index, and then sort
with the values of `rs` being the keys, then `ss[i]` will be the values.

In pictures:

```
rs[i]          [3 4 0 1 2]
rs_tagged[i]   [(3, 0) (4, 1) (0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 4)]
rs_sorted[i]   [(0, 2) (1, 3) (2, 4) (3, 0) (4, 1)]
ss[i]          [    2      3      4      0      1 ]
rs[ss[i]]      [ rs[2]  rs[3]  rs[4]  rs[0]  rs[1]]
rs[ss[i]]      [    0      1      2      3      4 ]
```

#### Rank and Select are inverses

It's nice, there are a couple of miracles that lined up here:

- Rank starts with `r` and select starts with `s` so we get nice naming.
- Rank and select are true inverse permutations of each other.

#### Generalized rank and select are adjoint

We had to "fix" our definition of rank to avoid equal elements in the array.
Hence, we had the rule that we also sort by indexes if the elements are
equal. However, if we now decide to ignore this rule, we will then recreate
the classical _adjunction_ between rank and select.

# [Proof of minkowski convex body theorem](#proof-of-minkowski-convex-body-theorem)

We can derive a proof of the minkowski convex body theorem starting from
Blichfeldt’s theorem.

#### Blichfeldt's theorem

This theorem allows us to prove that a set 
of large-enough-size in any lattice will have two points such that their
difference lies in the lattice. Formally, we have:

1. A lattice $L(B) \equiv \{ Bx : x \in \mathbb Z^n \}$ for some basis 
   $B \in \mathbb \R^n$. The lattice $L$ is spanned by integer linear
   combinations of rows of $B$.
2. A body $S \subseteq R^n$ which **need not be convex!**, which 
   has volume greater than $\det(B)$. Recall that for a lattice $L(B)$,
   the volume of a fundamental unit / fundamental parallelopiped is $det(B)$.


Blichfeldt's theorem tells us that there exists two points $x_1, x_2 \in S$
such that $x_1 - x_2 \in L$.

##### Proof

The idea is to:

1. Chop up sections of $S$ across all translates of the fundamental parallelopiped
   that have non-empty intersections with $S$ back to the origin. This makes
   all of them overlap with the fundamental parallelopiped with the origin.
2. Since $S$ has volume great that $\det(B)$, but the fundamental paralellopiped
   only has volume $\det(B)$, points from two different parallelograms **must**
   overlap.
3. "Undo" the translation to find two points which are of the form $x_1 = l_1 + \delta$,
   $x_2 = l_2 + \delta$. they must have the same $\delta$ since they overlapped
   when they were laid on the fundamental paralellopiped. Also notice that $l_1 \neq l_2$
   since they came from two different parallograms on the plane!
4. Notice that $x_1 - x_2 = l_1 - l_2\in L \neq 0$, since we already argued
   that $l_1 \neq l_2$. This gives us what we want.

#### Minkowskis' Convex body Theorem from Blichfeldt's theorem

Consider a convex set $S \subseteq \mathbb R^n$
that is symmetric about the origin with volume greater than $2^n det(B)$.

Create a new set $T$ which is $S * 0.5$. Formally:

$$T \equiv S/2 = \{ (x_1/2, x_2, \dots, x_n/2)  : (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) \in S \}$$

We now see that $Vol(T) > det(B)$ to invoke  Blichfeldt's theorem.
Formally:

$$Vol(T) = 1/2^n Vol(S) > 1/2^n (2^n det(B)) = det(B)$$

We can apply Blichfeldt's theorem to get our hands on two points $x_1, x_2 \in T$
such that $x_1 - x_2 \in L$. 

$$
\begin{align*}
&x_1 \in T \Rightarrow 2x_1 \in S ~(S = 2T) \\
&x_2 \in T \Rightarrow 2x_2 \in S ~(S = 2T) \\
&2x_2 \in S \Rightarrow -2x_2 \in S~\text{($S$ is symmetric about origin)} \\
&\frac{1}{2}(2x_1) + \frac{1}{2} (-2x_2) \in S~\text{($S$ is convex)}\\
&x_1 - x_2 \in S~\text{(Simplification)}\\
&\text{nonzero lattice point}~\in S \\
\end{align*}
$$

# [Burrows Wheeler](#burrows-wheeler)

We aim to get the $O(n)$ algorithm for burrows wheeler, by starting from the
naive $O(n^2)$ implementation and then slowly chipping away to get to the
fastest algorithm
                 
### String rotations

Given a string $s$ of length $n$, we can index it as $s[0]$, $s[1]$, upto
$s[n-1]$. We can now build a table consisting of _rotations_ of the string.
We'll define:

```hs
lrot :: [a] -> [a]
lrot [] = []; lrot (x:xs) = xs ++ [x]
```

We can build a table of left-rotations:

```
foobar
oobarf
obarfo
barfoo
arfoob
rfooba
```

We can immediately notice that it's a _symmetric matrix_. We can prove
this as follows. We write $lrot(rot, s)$ as an array such that:

$$
lrot(rot, s)[i] = s[(rot + i) % n] \text{where $n = |s|$}
$$

Now, we note that on row $r$ of our array we have the string $lrot(r, s)$.
So the value at row $r$, column $c$ is $lrot(r, s)[c] = s[(r + c)%n]$.
But this is symmetric in $c, r$ so can be written as $s[(c + r)%n]$,
which is equal to $lrot(c, s)[r]$. Formally:

$$
lrot(r, s)[c] = s[(r + c) %n] = s[(c + r)%n] = lrot(c, s)[r]
$$

### Sorts of string rotations

We're next interested in considering _sorted order_ of the string
rotations. For example, in the case of the string "here, there",
all the rotations are:

```
here-there  0
ere-thereh  1
re-therehe  2
e-thereher  3
-therehere  4
therehere-  5
herehere-t  6
erehere-th  7
rehere-the  8
ehere-ther  9
```

which is calculated with the help of the following haskell code:

```hs
lrot :: [a] -> [a]
lrot [] = []; lrot (a:as) = as ++ [a]

lrots :: [a] -> [[a]]; lrots as = take (length as) (iterate lrot as)

main =  putStrLn $ intercalate "\n"  
  (zipWith (\s i -> s <> "  " <> show i)
           (lrots "here-there") [0,1..])
```

If we now *sort* these rotations, we get:

```
-therehere  0
e-thereher  1
ehere-ther  2
ere-thereh  3
erehere-th  4
here-there  5
herehere-t  6
re-therehe  7
rehere-the  8
therehere-  9
```

we produce this by chainging the above definition of `main` to:

```
main =  putStrLn $ intercalate "\n"  
  (zipWith (\s i -> s <> "  " <> show i)
           -- | extra `sort` here
           (sort $ lrots "here-there") [0,1..])
```

Let's look at the **final column** of that table. We have:

```
-thereher|e|  0
e-therehe|r|  1
ehere-the|r|  2
ere-there|h|  3
erehere-t|h|  4
here-ther|e|  5 <- ORIGINAL STRING
herehere-|t|  6
re-thereh|e|  7
rehere-th|e|  8
therehere|-|  9

0123456789
errhhetee-
```

Now, we'll show how to write a _really cool_ function call `bwt` such that:

```hs
bwtinv ("errhhetee-",5) = "here-there"
```

The `5` is the index of the original string in the list. That is, given
the jumbled up last-column and the index of the original string, we're
able to reconstruct the original string. The reason this is useful is
that the jumbled string `"errhhetee-"` is easier to compress: it has
long runs of `r`, `h`, and `e` which makes it easier to compress.

The process we performed of rotating, sorting the rotations and taking
the final column is the Burrows-Wheeler transform. in code:

```hs
import Data.List
lrot :: [a] -> [a]
lrot [] = []; lrot (a:as) = as ++ [a]

lrots :: [a] -> [[a]]
lrots as = take (length as) (iterate lrot as)

findix :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Int
findix a as = length (takeWhile (/= a) as)

lastcol :: [[a]] -> [a]; lastcol = map last

bwt :: Eq a => Ord a => [a] -> ([a], Int)
bwt as = let as' = (sort . lrots) as in (lastcol as', findix as as')
```

Now we need to understand how `bwtinv` is defined and what it does.
The definition is:

```
import Control.Arrow (&&&)

bwtinv :: Eq a => Ord a => ([a], Int) -> [a]
bwtinv (as, k) = recreate as !! k

-- recreate · lastcol · sort · rots = sort · rots
recreate :: (Eq a, Ord a) => [a] -> [[a]]
recreate as = recreate' (length as) as

recreate' :: (Eq a, Ord a) => Int -> [a] -> [[a]]
recreate' 0 = map (const [])
recreate' n = hdsort . consCol . (id &&& recreate' (n-1))


hdsort :: Ord a => [[a]] -> [[a]]
hdsort = let cmp (x:xs) (y:ys) = compare x y
         in sortBy cmp 

consCol :: ([a], [[a]]) -> [[a]]
consCol = uncurry (zipWith (:))
```

OK, so much for the code. what does it _do_?

The idea is that:
- we recreate the entire matrix from the last column using `recreate`
  and take the `k`th element.

- `recreate` apprents a copy of the initial last column to a matrix of
  columns, and then sorts this.

_open sets_ form a Heytig Algebra, which is a lattice plus an implication
operator. So it's stronger than a lattice, but weaker than a boolean algebra.
Formally, a Heytig algebra over a set $X$ is a collection $(L, \lor, \land, \Rightarrow)$
where $(X, \lor, \land)$ form a lattice, and $\Rightarrow$ obeys the axiom

$$
\Rightarrow: L \rightarrow L; (c \land a) \leq b \iff c \leq (a \Rightarrow b)
$$

In any topological space $(U, \tau)$ ($U$ for universe set)
the open sets of that space form a Heytig algebra.
Here, set-union and set-intersection become the lattice join and lattice meet.
We define a "weak complement" denoted by $\lnot$ which is defined as:

$$
\lnot A \equiv \texttt{interior}(A^C)
$$

We need the $\texttt{interior}$ to make sure that we're left with an open
set. Also, this $\lnot$ is not really a complement, since we won't have that
$\lnot \lnot A = A$. but, more on that later!

We write open intervals with round parenthesis:

```
    A
--(===)--
```

$\lnot A$ of the above set $A$ becomes the open interval that is in the
interior of $A$ complement.


```
--(===)-- A
==]---[== A complement
==)---(== Not A
```

Now, we can try to ask, when is $\lnot \lnot A = U$ (where $U$ is the universe
set or the full space). If we consider a set containing a single point,
then we will have:


```
==)(== A 
------------ Not A  
============ Not (Not A)
```
in words:

$$
\begin{align*}
&A = U \setminus \{ 1 \} \\
&\lnot A = \texttt{interior}(A^c) = \texttt{interior}(\{ 1 \}) = \emptyset \\
&\lnot \lnot A = \texttt{interior}((\lnot A)^c) = \texttt{interior}(\emptyset^c) = \texttt{interior}(U) = U \\
\end{align*}
$$

So in some sense, the law of excluded middle is "almost true": It holds that $A \simeq \lnot \lnot A$,
where $A$ excludes a set of points of measure zero.
This is really interesting, since it gives some sort of oddball probabilistic
flavour to things where if we blind ourselves to measure-0 sets, then $\lnot \lnot A = A$.


Now, we look at implication. The implication $A \Rightarrow B$ is the largest
set open $C$ such that $C \land A = B$. In pictures:

```
---(========)----- A
---------(=====)-- B
---------(==)----- A && B
===)-----(======== A -> B
```

The reason this is true is that from the definition:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\Rightarrow: L \rightarrow L;  c \leq (a \Rightarrow b) \iff (c \land a) \leq b \\
&\text{replacing $\leq$ with $=$ for insight:}
&\Rightarrow: L \rightarrow L;  c = (a \Rightarrow b) \iff (c \land a) = b  \\
\end{align*}
$$

Alternatively, we can use the fact that in regular boolean algebra:
                    
$$a \Rightarrow b = \lnot a \lor b$$

to derive $A -> B$:

```
---(========)----- A
===)--------(===== NOT A
---------(=====)-- B
[Extend B to everything that doesn't include
  more of A than already included]
===)-----(======== NOT A or B = A -> B
```


#### `a -> b` as `a` contained in `b`:

We'll show that `a -> b` is true/top/the full real line if and only if
`a` is contained in `b`. We can show this using $\lnot a \lor b$ definition:

1. $a \leq b$ (given)
2. Since $a \leq b$, $\lnot a \geq \lnot b$, since $\lnot$ reverses inclusion order.
3. $x \geq y$ implies that $x \lor p \geq y \lor p$ for all p, since $p$ is 
   on both sides.
4. Specializing to $x = \lnot a$, $y = \lnot b$, $p = b$ gives us
   $\lnot a \lor b \geq \lnot b \lor b$
5. $\lnot b \lor b$ is universe $U$
6. $\lnot a \lor b \geq U$, which means it's equal to $U$ (nothing can be greater than $U$).

We can also show this geometrically:

```
----------(===)---- A
------(==========) B
----------(===)---- A && B
[Extend B to everything that doesn't include
  more of A than already included.
  But all of A is
  already included!]
================== A -> B
```


#### reading `curry`, `uncurry` using `a -> b` as containment:

`curry`, `uncurry` are the adjunction/isomorphism:

```
((c,a) -> b) ~ (c -> (a -> b))
```

Read this as:

```
( c     ,         a)     ->         b
(c `intersection` a) `contained in` b
```

if and only if

```
c      ->        (a       ->      b)
c `contained in` (a `implication` b)
```

That is, we have "read" `curry/uncurry` as:

$$
c \land a \leq b \iff c \leq a \Rightarrow b
$$

which was the definition of $\Rightarrow$ we wanted!

# [Edit distance](#edit-distance)

This implementation of edit distance crystallizes the fact that when computing
edit distance, we only ever move forwards on solving the problem. we _do not_
store the results of the overlapping computations, though we could. Rather,
the goal of this implementation is to capture the traversal pattern necessary
for edit distance into a `Cursor`, and to view the edit distance problem from
the point of view of this `Cursor`. 

The problem setting is that we have a source string, a destination
string, and we wish to perform operations that convert the source
string into the destination string. The operations allowed are to:

- Insert a character from the destination to the source.
- Remove a character from the source.
- Replace a character in the source with a character from the destination.

We want to minimise the number of operations to be used. 
Let's see how we model this.


```hs
{-# LANGUAGE ViewPatterns #-}
type Ix = Int; type DestIx = Ix; type SrcIx = Ix;
data Move = InsertFromDest DestIx |
            RemoveFromSrc SrcIx |
            ReplaceSrcWithDest SrcIx DestIx
        deriving(Show)
```

Our cost model says that each move costs `1`. We are charged for every
move we make. We are to minimize the number of operations.

```hs
movescost :: [Move] -> Int; movescost = length
```

We model this as us having a `Cursor` which contains  list `[a]` and information
about where we are in the list as an `Ix`. 
This is the same as a `Zipper` for a list, except that in this case, we only
allow ourselves to walk forward. 

```hs
data Cursor a = Cursor Ix [a]
```


- `cdone` tells is if we have completely consumed a cursor.
- `cix` tells us the index of the cursor.
- `cval` lets us dereference a cursor.
- `incr` lets us move a cursor to the next array entry.
- `cursor` converts a list into a `Cursor` at the first index.

```hs
cdone :: Cursor a -> Bool; cdone (Cursor ix vs) = ix >= length vs
cix :: Cursor a -> Ix; cix (Cursor ix _) = ix
cval :: Cursor a -> a; cval c@(Cursor ix vs) = vs !! ix
incr :: Cursor a -> Cursor a; incr (Cursor ix vs) = Cursor (ix+1) vs
cursor :: [a] -> Cursor a; cursor = Cursor 0
```

We implement `edit`, that tells us how to edit the source string into
the destination string. The convention is `edit <src-str> <dest-str>`.

```hs
-- | decide how to get ixth character of bs from our as.
edit :: Eq a => Cursor a -> Cursor a -> [Move]
```

- 1. If both strings have been consumed, then no moves are to be made.

```hs
edit (cdone -> True) (cdone -> True) = []
```

- 2. If the destination string has been fully matched while the source string
   has not, then remove characters from the source string.

```hs
edit a@(cdone -> False) b@(cdone -> True) = 
  (RemoveFromSrc (cix a)):edit (incr a) b
```

- 3. If the source string has run out of characters while the destination string
   still has characters, insert characters from the destination string.

```hs
edit a@(cdone -> True) b@(cdone -> False) = 
  (InsertFromDest (cix b)):edit a (incr b)
```

- 4. Otherwise, we have characters remaining in both strings. Try the
   options of (1) replacing a source character with a destination 
   character (2) removing a character from the source and continuing,
   and (3) if the current characters match, then keep the match and try
   to combine characters that come later in the string. We pick the
   best out of these using the `argmin` combinator.

```hs
edit a b =  
  let nomatch = argmin movescost 
                (ReplaceSrcWithDest (cix a) (cix b):edit (incr a) (incr b))
                (RemoveFromSrc (cix a):edit (incr a) b) 
  in case cval a == cval b of
      True -> argmin movescost nomatch (edit (incr a) (incr b))
      False -> nomatch 
```
      
The helper used for finding minimum according to a cost model.

```hs
argmin :: (a -> Int) -> a -> a -> a
argmin f a a' = if (f a) < (f a') then a else a'
```

# [Evolution of bee colonies](#evolution-of-bee-colonies)

This kind of culture that beehives have is called as 'eusociality'.
I'm interested in this because I want to understand what alien societies might
look like, and what selection pressures are required to have bee-like societies
evolve. Many sci-fi books (Ender's game for example) depict aliens with such
a society, but tend to be hazy on how this state of affairs came to be.


- [Evolution of eusociality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_eusociality)


# [Best practices for array indexing](#best-practices-for-array-indexing)

These are rules I'm going to follow when I solve problems on 
[codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). I've arrived at these rules by repeatedly
noticing the kinds of mistakes I make and attempting to adopt conventions
to eliminate these.

##### Rule 1: Half-open intervals

Intervals are only represented as `[begin, past-the-end)` That is, we start at
`begin`, include numbers `begin+1, begin+2, ...`, upto, **but excluding**
`past-the-end`.

So, for example, `[0, 3) = [0, 1, 2]`, while `[0, 1) = [0]`, and `[0, 0) = []`.


I am not allowed to use `[begin, end]`, or `(before-begin, past-the-end)` or
any such variation I represent and think of intervals.

##### Rule 2: No relational operators when using `for/while/do while` loops.

When I write my loop conditions, I am not allowed to use relational operators.
I must only write `i != n` or `i == m`.
I am not allowed to write `i < n`, `i <= n`, `i > n`, `i >= n` for my `for` loops.


##### Rule 3: The loop iterator lives in "getting to" space:

The loop iterator `i` in `for(int i = a; i != b; ++i)` is to be thought of as
getting to/living right before" the values `[a, a+1, a+2, ... b-1]`. In
ASCII-art:

```
|| a-1 || a   || a+1 || ... || b-1 ||  b  || b+1 ||
       ^^     ^^     ^^            ^^
     (i=a) (i=a+1)  (i=a+2) ...   (i=b)
```

##### Ruel 4: One always reads loops according to the above rules

```c
for(int i = begin; i != past-the-end; ++i) {
  // NO: i from begin to past-the-end.
  // YES: [i _getting to_ the beginning] till [i _getting_ past-the-end]
}
```

#### The rationale for banning relational operators

There is a strong difference in qualia between `i < n` and `i != n`. The former
makes on aware of when the loop runs; the latter of when the loop quits.

I wish to be cognizant of the precisely when a loop quits. 
On writing `i != past-the-end`, I know that we quit as soon as we
**get past the end**. This feels much clearer than being aware that the loops
runs as long as `i < n`.

#### half-open indexing: length <-> index

The first advantage of these conventions is that 
`[begin, past-the-end)` is the same as `[begin, begin+length)`. I've found this
to be of great help to flit between length-based-thoughts and
indexing-based-thoughts.


#### half-open indexing: `0` length

The second almost trivial point is that `[begin, begin+length)` holds when
`length` is **zero**. That is,

```c
for(int i = begin; i != begin + 0; ++ i) { ... }
```

does the right thing and iterates over no elements.


#### half-open indexing: `-ve` length

The third neat point is that `[begin, begin+length)` holds even when `length`
is **negative**. Hence, if we want to index the last two elements of an
array, we recall that we start from index `(n-1)`, and we want a segment
of length `-2` from there, so our loop is:


```c
for(int i = n-1; i != (n-1) + -2; i--) {
 // loops over the correct segment.
}
```


#### half-open indexing: splitting an array

Finally, this convention helps when attempting to take the beginning part
of a list and the rest of the list. If we want to split an array into
two segments at some index `len`,

- The first sub-array is `[0, len)` since it starts at location `0` and has
  length `len`.
- Since we have taken `len` elements, the second sub-array must have length
  `n-len`. It must start at index `len` since `len` is past-the-end for the
  first sub-array. So, the second sub-array has indeces `[len, n-len)`.

Notice how we used _both_ the "length view" and the "past the end" view to
quickly derive the bounds of the second array from the first array.

#### half-open indexing: uniformly generate power-of-2 intervals.

If we want intervals of length $2^n$: `1, 2, 4, 8, ...` which is common if one
is building data structures such as segment trees and fenwick trees, 
in a half-open representation, this literally becomes `[a, a+1)`, 
`[a, a+2)`, `[a, a+4)` and so on. On the other hand, if one wants
to use closed interval based indexing, one needs to generate the
series $2^n - 1$, which is `[a, a+0]`, `[a, a+3]`, `[a, a+7]` which is
slightly more finicky.

#### How to deal with strides

If there's a loop

```c
for(int i = 0; i < 5; i += 2) { ... }
```

the naive `i != 5` translation will not work since `i` only takes
on even numbers `[0, 2, 4, 6, ...]`. For this, we can perform a
simple transformation and always make sure our loop variables increment
by `1`. In a compiler, this is often called as "canonicalizing the loop
induction variable". In LLVM the canonicalization is
[performed by the `-indvars` pass](https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#indvars-canonicalize-induction-variables).
The above example canonicalized becomes:

```c
// btc = backedge taken count. How many times we have
// gone past the "back edge" of the loop to go back to the
// beginning of the loop.
for(int btc = 0; btc != 5 / 2; btc += 1) { const int i = btc * 2; }
```


#### In conclusion

These are rules that I dreamed up after noticing my idiosyncracies in
loop-writing.



# Algebraic structure for vector clocks

_I_ update my time, ie, union(time me, time me), I get an element that's one up the lattice.
When I union with someone else, I get the max. So we have an algebraic structure
which is $(L, \leq, next: L \rightarrow L)$ where `next` is monotone for `(L, <=)`.
The  induced union operator $\cup: L \times L \rightarrow L$ is:

$$
x \cup y \equiv \begin{cases} next(x) & x = y  \\ max(x, y) & x \neq y \end{cases}
$$

- Is the total ordering on vector clocks *not* isomorphic to the total ordering on $\mathbb{R}$?


This also shows up in the case of the "Gallager-Humblet-Spira Algorithm" and
the fragment-name-union-rule.

# [Networks are now faster than disks](#networks-are-now-faster-than-disks)

I learnt of this counter-intutive fact first from this
[usenix article no SQL](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/login/2011-10/openpdfs/Burd.pdf).
On checking up, it seems to actually be true. 

[Jeff Dean's keynote at LADIS 2009](https://research.cs.cornell.edu/ladis2009/talks/dean-keynote-ladis2009.pdf) report these numbers:

- Round trip within same datacenter: 500,000 ns
- Disk seek: 10,000,000 ns [regular disk]

On the other hand, a commentor on [this discussion at serverfault](https://serverfault.com/questions/238417/are-networks-now-faster-than-disks)
mentioned that SSDs might be much faster, and the numbers bear out:

- Read 4K randomly from SSD: 150,000 ns
- Round trip within same datacenter: 500,000 ns
- Disk seek: 10,000,000 ns [regular disk]

# [Einstein-de Haas effect](#einstein-de-haas-effect)

I learnt of this from hacker news. This is some crazy experiment that shows
that the 'quantum angular momentum' (spin) and the 'classical angular momentum'
need to be conserved _together_ for physics to work out:

> There's an experiment that transfers that angular momentum all the way up to
> macroscopic levels. By magnetizing a cylinder of iron, all the spins start
> pointing in the same direction. By conservation of angular momentum, the
> cylinder itself has to start spinning in the opposite direction. I'm very
> fond of this experiment, because it magnifies a strange quantum phenomenon to
> the classical level.

So, my understanding of the experiment is:

- classical angular momentum and quantum angular momentum are related.
- quantum angular momentum is decomposed into spin and orbital angular momentum.
- for something like iron, spin is 96% of magnetization
- angular momentum is proportional to magnetization
- So, the experiment measures the _spin_ (mostly) in terms of the classical
  spinning of the cylinder.

# [Rank-select as adjunction](#rank-select-as-adjunction)

We will introduce two operations `rank`, `select`, --- these are used to
build memory-efficient data structures that can still be queried quickly.

We will show how `rank` and `select` are adjoint. This will also us to also
consider `coselect`, which is a variation of `select` that is not commonly
discussed.

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}

import Data.List
newtype Count = Count Int deriving(Eq, Show, Ord, Num)
newtype Ix = Ix Int deriving(Eq, Show, Ord, Num)


eqscan :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Count]
eqscan a0 as = map Count $ scanl (+) 0 [if a0 == a then 1 else 0 | a <- as]

-- | finds the index `Ix` in `as` at which `a` has occured
-- | for the `Count`th time.
select :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Count -> Maybe Ix
select a0 as c = Ix <$> findIndex (== c) (eqscan a0 as)

-- | finds the number of times `a` has occured in `as` till `Ix`.
rank :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Ix -> Count
rank a as (Ix ix) = (eqscan a as) !! ix
```

Given this, we can prove that `select` and `rank` are adjunctions. There
are different ways to think about this. My favourite way to is to notice
that an `Ix` (index) is much "finer" information than `Count`. Hence,
the concrete domain must be `Ix`, the abstract domain must be `Count`,
and rank-select is an abstract interpretation!

##### Co-select

We can build another version of `select` called `co-select` that scans
from the right. Alternatively, it finds on the reverse list:

```
coselect :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Count -> Maybe Ix
coselect a0 as c = Ix <$> findIndex (== c) (reverse (eqscan a0 as))
```

Thanks to Edward Kmett for teaching me this.


# [Bounding chains: uniformly sample colorings](#bounding-chains-uniformly-sample-colorings)

We wish to _uniformly sample_ `k` colorings of a graph $G$ with maximum degree
$\Delta$. Hence, we require $k \geq \Delta + 1$. To perform this sampling,
we use MCMC to sample from a markov chain whose states are $k$-colorings of $G$,
whose stationary distribution is the uniform distribution over valid colorings.


The issue with MCMC techniques is that we never know when our chain has reached
the stationary state. To ensure we receive uniformly distributed samples,
we built a "bounding chain" $W$ which has the following properties:

- States of $W$ cover states of $X$ [ie, state space of $W$ are subsets of the state space of $X$].
- $W$'s convergence to a stationary state can be checked.
- Upon convergence of $W$, state of $W$ = state of $X$.

We will in fact run the $W$ chain, and prove that running the $W$ chain
is equivalent to running a 'shadow' of the $X$ chain, and that stationary
states of the $W$ chain correspond to stationary sates of the $X$ chain.

Let $X$ be the chain whose states are valid $k$ colorings of $G$. In one step
of the chain $X$, we choose a vertex $v$ uniformly at random; we then choose a
color $c'_v$ uniformly at random for $v$ that makes it a proper coloring. The vertex
$v$ is changed to this new color $c'$. This is a symmetric proposal distribution,
Hence this chain has the uniform distribution over $k$-colorings to be
the stationary state.

Sampling exactly from this chain is hard: construct an initial state $X_0$
amounts to finding some valid $k$ coloring which in itself might be
challenging. Worse, we do not know whether the chain $X$ has reached a
stationary state or not.

##### Bounding Chain

We construct a new chain $W$ (the bounding chain of $X$), whose states are _sets of colors_ for
vertices in $G$. Formally, the states of $W$ are functions $Vert(G) \rightarrow 2^C$ where
$Vert(G)$ denotes the vertices of $G$; $C$ the set of colors. The transition
will be to pick a vertex $v$ uniformly at random. Then, pick a new set of
legal colors $C'_v$ for $v$, such that:

- It is guaranteed that if $X$ were transitioning on $v$, the
  color $c'_v$ that would be picked by $X$ for $v$ is a member of $C'_v$. [state is covered]
- The size of the set $C'_v$ attempts to be smaller than the current set of colorings $C_v$. [convergence]

We describe the transition function next. But first, we need an alternate
lens on the transitions of $X$ that is amenable to massaging. 

#### Equivalent description of the transitions of $X$:

1. Choosing a color uniformly at random from the set of valid colors
   for a vertex.
2. Choosing colors from $C$ without replacement until we get a color 
   that is a valid color. 

We claim that (1) and (2) have the same probability distribution.

Abstracting slightly, we state:

1. Probability of choosing an element $t \in T$ uniformly from  $T \subseteq S$.
   This has probability $1/|T|$.
2. Probability of choosing a particular element $t \in T$, by picking elements
   from $S$ without replacement until we get some element in $T$.

(1) and (2) have the same probability distribution.

##### Proof by induction:

Process (2) in code is the following:

```py
def process(S, T):
  assert(issubset(T, S)) # precondition
  s = np.random.choice(S) # uniform choice over S.
  if s in T: return s # |T|/|S| prob. to enter `if`.
  else:
    # (1 - |T|/|S|) to enter `else`
    Snext = S.remove(s); return process(Snext, T) 
```


We claim that the probability that `process(S, T) = t0` for a fixed `t0` in `T`
is $1/|T|$. We create a new function `indicator` to express this:



```py
def indicator(t0, S, T):
  assert(t0 in T) # precondition
  assert(issubset(T, S)) # precondition

  return t0 == process(S, T)
```

Let's push in `t0 ==` into the definiton of `process` after inling `process`.
This gives us:

```py
def indicator(t0, S, T):
  assert(t0 in T) # precondition
  assert(issubset(T, S)) # precondition

  s = np.random.choice(S)
  if s in T:
    # T/S prob. for x in T
    return t0 == s # 1/|T| prob. for t0 == x
  else:
    #  (1 - |T|/|S|) to reach else branch.
    Snext = S.remove(s); return process(Snext, T) 

```

Now, we write down the recurrence for the probability that we are trying
to compute: $P(t0, S, T)$ is the probability that `indicator(t0, S, T)` returns
`True`. Alternatively, it's the probability that `process(S, T)` returns `t0`.

```
P(t0, S, T) = prob. that process(S, T) = t0
P(t0, T, T) = T/|T| * 1/|T| = 1/|T| [base case]
P(t0, S, T) = 1/|S| + (1 - |T|/|S|) * P(t0, |S|-1, T) [induction]
```

We assume for induction that `P(t0, |S|-1, T) = 1/|T|`. On substitution into `[induction]`,
we get:

```
P(t0, S, T) 
= 1/|S| + (1 - |T|/|S|) * P(t0, |S|-1, T) [induction]
= 1/|S| + (1 - |T|/|S|) * 1/|T| 
= 1/|S| + (1/|T| - 1/|S|)s
= 1/|T|
```
Which is indeed the same probability as (1):

> 1. Choosing an element uniformly from a subset $T$ = `1/|T|`.

##### Proof by program analysis, Version 1

```py
def process(S, T):
  s = np.random.choice(S)
  if s in T: return s
  else return process(S.remove(s), T)
```

Notice that the last return is tail-call. This program can be rewritten as:

```py
def process(S, T):
  while True:
    s = np.random.choice(S)
    if s in T: return s
    S = S.remove(s)
```

As previously, we create an `indicator` function and study its behaviour:

```py
def indicator(t0, S, T):
  assert(t0 in T) # precondition
  assert(issubset(T, S)) # precondition

  while True:
    s = np.random.choice(S)
    if s in T: return t0 == s
    S = S.remove(s)
```

We know that this programs only returns a value from the line:
- `if s in T: return t0 == s`

We now compute `P(process(S, T) == t0)`.
Whatever the return value of `indicator`, we can assume that it occured within
the `if` condition. We can use this to compute:

```
P(indicator(t0, S, T) = True)
 = P(t0 == s | s in T) [program only returns in this case]
 = 1/|T|
```

##### Proof by program analysis, Version 2


Alternatively, we can also analyze this as we did in the _first_ proof,
using the rule:

```py
def f():
  return if cond1 then cond2 else cond3
```

will have probability:

```
P(cond1) * P(cond2|cond1) + P(not cond1) * P(cond3|not cond1)
```

Using this, we can analyze `indicator `as:

```
P(indicator(t0, S, T) = True)
 = P(s in T) * P(t0 == s |s in T) + 
    P(s not in T) * P(indicator(t0, S.remove(s), T) | s not in T)
 = |T|/|S| * 1/|T| + 
    (|S|-|T|)/|S| * P(indicator(t0, S.remove(s), T))
 = 1/|S| + (|S|-|T|)/|S| * 1/|T| [by induction]
 = 1/|T|
```

#### Sampling using the above definition

Recall that $State(X) \equiv V \rightarrow C$, $State(W) \equiv V \rightarrow 2^C$.
Let $x[~], w[~]$ be the states of some run in the markov chains.

We start by having $x[0]$ to be _any_ valid k-coloring of $G$, and $w[0]$ to
be the state where all vertices have all possible colors; $w[0] \equiv \_ \mapsto C$.
Clearly, $x[0] \in w[0]$.


By induction we assume that $x[n-1] \in w[n-1]$. We must now calculate a
$w[n], x[n]$ such that (1) $x[n] \in w[n]$, (2) $x[n]$'s proposal is symmetric. 
(3) $w[n]$'s proposal is symmetric.

##### Occluded set $O$

Define $O \subseteq C$ (for occluded) be the set colors that might possibly
be blocked for $v$ from our view of `w`. Note that this is an
**over-approxmation**: that is, there may be colors that are not blocked for `v`, which we
believe to be blocked from `w`'s point of view.

$$O \equiv  \{ c \in C : (v, \alpha) \in E, c \in w[n-1](\alpha) \}$$

##### Allowed set $A$

Define $A \subset C$ (for allowed) to be $C - O$. Note that $A$ is
an **under-approxmation**, since `O` was an _over-approximation_. That is:
- Any color in `A` is definitely a legal color for `v` in `x[n]`.  
- There are colors which are legal for `v` in `x[n]` that is not in `A`.

##### S: the sequence of states for transition

Now, we pick elements of $C$ in sequence till we get an element of `A`.
call this sequence $S$. 

We will at worst pick $\Delta + 1$ elements for $S$, since the max-degree
of the graph is $\Delta$.

##### Transition

Let $i$ be the first index in $S$ where we get a color that is _truly legal_
for $v$ in $x[n]$. Note that such an index will always exist: We pick
elements into $S$ till we get an element in $A$, and elements of $A$ are 
always legal. However, there can be elements which are not in $A$ that
are still legal for $v$ in $x[n]$, since $A$ is an under-approximation.

- We assign $x[n](v) = i$. So, `x` only cares about `S[:i]`.
- We assign  $w[n](v) = A$. So, `W` cares about the entire sequence.

By the lemma proven, we know that this process of picking colors `C` 
in a sequence till we get a color that is legal for $v$ at index $i$
is the same as picking uniformly at random from the set of colors that are legal for 
$v$. 


#### An example
For example, we could have:

```
X | p:2 --- q:4
W | p:{1, 2} --- q:{4, 5}

we are sampling q:

O = {1, 2}
A = {3, 4, 5}
S = [2, 1, 3]

X | p:1 -- q:2 
W | p:{1, 2} -- q:{1, 2, 3}
```

If we analyze `S = [2, 1, 3]` we notice that:

```
2: invalid for W(p:[1, 2]), invalid for X(p:2)    
1: invalid for W, valid for X  
3: valid for W, valid for X
```

So, what we are really sampling ix:
- A _prefix_ sequence `SX = [1]` (for Xs transition)
- A _leftover_ sequence `SW = [2, 3]` (for Ws transition)


To transition `X`, we can safely drop `SW`. However, to transition `W` correctly,
we generate more elements in the sequence, till we hit a "safe" element.


#### An optimisation on picking colors: why we need a blocking set


Define the set $B \subseteq C$ (for blocked) which governs which values
$x[n]$ **surely cannot take** from our view of $w[n-1]$.
Note that $B$ is an **under-approximation**. `v` might have
more colors that are blocked than what `w` sees.

$$B \equiv \{ c \in C : (v, \alpha) \in E, w[n-1](\alpha) = \{c\} \}$$
       
Rather than sampling colors from `C` till we get an element of `A`, we can
sample colors from `C/B`. We know that the colors in `B` can **never** be used 
by $X$, since the colors in `B` are those that we know are blocked **for sure**.

This is used in the theoretical analysis of the paper.

#### Termination

We terminate when $W$ has "trapped" $X$. That is, $|w[n](v)| = 1$ forall $v \in V$.
In such a case, the states of $W$ is equal to states of $X$. This is
a coalescence (as it occurs in coupling from the past). From the coupling
from the past theory, we know that we have reached a stationary state of $A$
when this happens.


#### Pseudocode

```hs
-- | colors, vertices, edges
cs :: [C]; cs = ...
vs :: [V]; vs = ...
es :: [(V, V); es = ...


-- | definitely not allowed
blocked :: (V -> [C]) -> (V -> [C])
blocked v2cs v0 = concat [v2cs w | (v, w) <- es, v == v0, length (v2cs w) == 1]


-- | maybe not allowed
occluded :: (V -> [C]) -> (V -> [C])
occluded v2cs v0 = concat [v2cs w | (v, w) <- es, v == v0]

-- | definitely allowed from Ws point of view
allowed :: (V -> [C]) -> (V -> [C])
allowed v2cs = cs \\ occluded v2cs 

-- | perturb the color function to another function
perturb :: (V -> [C]) -> Rand (V -> [C])
perturb v2cs = do $ 
  randv <- uniform_rand vs
  randc_for_v <- uniform_rand (allowed v2cs v)
  return $ \v -> if v == randv then randc_for_v else v2cs v
  

-- | check if we are done
terminated :: (V -> [C]) -> Bool
terminated v2cs = all [length (v2cs v) == 1 | v <- vs]

-- | generate chain
chain :: (V -> [C]) -> Rand [V -> [C]]
chain f = do
  if terminated f 
  then [] else do 
    f;' <- perturb f; fs <- chain f'; return (f:fs)

-- | return a sample
sample :: (V -> [C]) -> Rand (V -> [C])
sample = last . chain

```

I find this incredibly fascinating. I think I'm going to try this: I'll listen
to lectures on `1.5-2x` anyway, so this may work just as well. I'm planning
on trying this with the MLIR codebase, which I want to get to know intimately.
I'll write updates on how this goes.

## [Self modifying code for function calls: Look ma, I don't need a stack!](#self-modifying-code-for-function-calls-look-ma-i-dont-need-a-stack)

If one does not have recursive calls, one can eliminate the need to push
return addresses on a call stack by writing self-modifying code ---
I leant of this from TAOCP, volume 1. 
Knuth shows this off once he introduces `MIXAL`, his fantasy
aseembly language in which TAOCP programs are written.

I'll explain the usual way one performs call-return, then explain the nifty
self-modifying-code way. I think this is the cleanest, most accessible
example of self-modifying-code that I know. 

#### The traditional solution for `call/ret`

We wish to have function `f` call function `g`. For `g` to be able to
return control to `f`, `f` pushes a return address into the call stack,
that `g` pops and `jmp`s to

```
f's body
START_F:
      ...
L0    push addr(L0); location of instr to be run after call.
      jmp START_G
L1:   <code after call>
```

```
g's body
START_G:
      ...
      retloc = pop ; pop location to jump to
RETG: jmp retloc
```

Rather than `push`ing and `pop`ing, we can _rewrite_ the code of `g`, to _change_ `retloc` before a call
to `g`. In made-up-pseudocode, here's what that would look like:


#### The jump based solution

```
* f's body
START_F:
      ...
L0    store loc(RETG) assemble(jmp addr(L1))
      jmp START_G
L1:   <code after call>
```

```
* g's body
START_G:
      ...
RETG: <###-to-be-filled-dummy-###>
```

instead of having a call stack, before `f` calls g, `f` modify `g`'s code at location `RETG`
into a `jmp` instruction by `store` ing the instruction `jmp addr(L1)`.
This effectively creates a 'custom' `g` that knows how  to return
control flow into `f`.

```
* g's body (after execution of L0)
START_G:
      ...
RETG: jump addr(L1)
```

This way, we have obviated the need for a `push/pop` sequence, by directly
modifying `g`'s code. This is really neat --- we replace the overhead of
a `push/pop` with a single `store`.

#### Why recursion breaks.

We don't actually need a call stack, as long as we don't want to write recursive functions.
We can't have recursion, or more generally "re-entrance": consider a call chain of the form:

- `A -> B -> C -> B`.
- during `A -> B`, `A` will scribble a `<return to A>` into `B`.
- during  `B -> C`, `B` will scribble a `<return to  B>` into `C`.
- during `C -> B`, `C` will scribble `<return to C>` into `B`,
  **destroying the previous `<return to A>` **.
- This creates a cycle, where `C` will attempt to return to `B`
  and vice versa.


## [Adjunctions as advice](#adjunctions-as-advice)

An adjunction `F |- U` allows us to go from `F a -> x` to `a -> U x`. We 
can look at this as shifting the "before-advice" from the _input_ to an 
"after advice" of the _output_, where I'm using
<!-- [advice in the CLOS/LISP sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_(programming)) -->

Also, to remember this, we can write it as:

```
F a <--F--- a
|           |
v           v
x ----U--> U x
```

Where `F` is for `F`ree and `U` is for forgetf`U`l.
Recall that if `F` is free and `U` is forgetful, then `U(F(x)) = x`, since
adding more structure through the free functor and then stripping it away gives
us the object back. We can prove that if `U(F(x)) = x` and `U, F` are functors,
then we have a function `fwd: (f a -> x) -> (a -> u x)` as:

```
f      :: (f a -> x) 
fmap   :: (p   -> q) -> (u p     -> u q)
fmap   :: (p   -> q) -> (u ( p ) -> u q)
fmap f :: (f a -> x) -> (u (f a) -> u x) 
fmap f :: (f a -> x) -> (a       -> u x) [using u (f a) = a]
```

## [Reversible computation as groups on programs](#reversible-computation-as-groups-on-programs)

If we consider a language like [`Janus`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(time-reversible_computing_programming_language)
where every program is reversible, we can then get a group structure on
programs with the identity program not computing anything at all, the inverse
performing the reverse operation. 

Alternatively, one can use the trick from quantum mechanics of using anciliary
qubits to build reversible classical gates. 

The question is, do either of these approaches allow for better-than-STOKE
exploration of the program space? Ie, can we somehow exploit the 
discrete group structure (in the case of Janus) or the Lie group structure
of the unitary group (as in the QM case) to find programs in far quicker ways?

## [Blazing fast math rendering on the web](#blazing-fast-math-rendering-on-the-web)

So, I've shifted the blog to be static-site-generated using a
static-site-generator written by yours truly. The code clocks in at around a
thousand lines of C++:

- [bollu/bollu.github.io/builder/builder.cpp](https://github.com/bollu/bollu.github.io/tree/master/builder/builder.cpp)

What did I gain?

1. My generator is a real compiler, so I get errors on math and markdown
  malformation.
2. I can write math that _loads_ instantly on your browser, using no MathJax,
   KaTeX or any client side processing, _nor_ the need to fetch images, which looks like this:

$$
h(x) \equiv 
\begin{cases} 
\int_{i=0}^\infty f(x) g(x) dx & x > 0 \\
\sum_{i=0}^\infty f(x) + g(x) & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

#### Why?

My blog is a [single 9000 line markdown file](https://github.com/bollu/bollu.github.io/blob/master/README.md),
rendered as a _single HTML page_, so I 
_need it to compile fast, render fast, render beautiful_. 
Existing tools compromise on one or the other.

#### No seriously, why a single markdown file?

I need a single file to edit, so I can rapidly jot down new ideas. This is 
the essence of why I'm able to log most of what I study: 
_because it's seamless_.

Far more importantly, it provides **spatio-temporal locality**. I add things
in chronological order to tbe blog, as I learn thing. If I need to recall
something I had studied, go to that location in the blog 
_based on a sense of when_. 

When I do get to a location I want, the scrollbar gives me a sense of 
_where I am_ in the file.  this is important to me, since it hepls me reason
spatially about what i know and what I've learnt. It's someting I love about
books, and deeply miss when navigtaing the web.I'm determined to keep this
spatio-temporal locality on my little slice of the internet.

#### Why is this awful?

As elegant as this model is to _edit_, it's awful for browsers to render. The
file used to take on the order of minutes for all the math to finish
rendering. MathJax (and KaTeX) painfully attempt to render each
math block. As they do, the page jumps around until everything has settled.
As this is happening, your CPU throttles, your lap or hand gets warm,
and the page is stuck. Clearly not great UX.

I still want math. What do I do?  The solution is easy: Approximate the math
rendering using ASCII/UTF-8 characters!  There are tools that do this ---
[`hevea`](http://hevea.inria.fr/) is one of them. Unfortunately, there is no
markdown-based-blogging-platform that uses this, so I _had_ to write my own.

#### The cure

The solution is easy. I wrote the tool. The page you're reading it
is rendered using the tool. All the math renders in under a second because
it's nothing crazy, it's just text and tables which browsers know how to
render. No JavaScript necessary. snappy performance. Whoo!

#### The details: Writing my own Markdown to HTML transpiler.

the final transpiler clocks in at `1300Loc` of C++,
which is very small for a feature-complete markdown-to-HTML piece of code
that's blazing fast, renders math correctly, and provides error messages.

#### Quirks fixed, features gained.

I got quite a bit "for free" as I wrote this, fixing mild annoyances
and larger pain points around using github + markdown for publishing on
the web:

- I really don't want tables, but I do want the ability to write vertical bars 
  `|` freely in my text. Unfortunately, github _insists_ that those are tables,
   and completely wrecks rendering.

- I get line numbers in code blocks now, which Github Flavoured Markdown
  did not have.

- I get error messages on incorrectly closed bold/italic/code blocks, using
  heuristics that prevent them from spanning across too many lines.

- I get error messages on broken latex, since all my latex passes through
  `hevea`. This is awesome, since I no longer need to refresh my browser,
  wait for mathjax to load, go make myself tea (remember that mathjax was slow?),
  and then come back to see the errors.

- I can get error messages if my internal document links are broken. To be
  fair, my tool doesn't currently give me these errors, but it can (and soon
  will).

- In general, I get _control_, which was something I did not have with
  rendering directly using Github, or using someone else's tool.

#### Choice of language

I choose to write this in C-style-C++, primarily because I wanted the tool
to be fast, and I'd missed writing C++ for a while. I really enjoy how
stupid-simple C style C++ turns out to be: the C++ papers over some of C's
annoyances (like formatted output for custom types), while still preserving the
KISS feeling of writing C++.

**Why not Rust?** I freely admit that rust might have been a sane choice as
well.  unfortunately, asking rust to treat UTF-8 string as a "ball of bytes" is
hard, when it's stupidly easy with C. Plus, I wanted to use arena-style-allocation
where I make _huge_ allocations in one go and then don't think about memory,
something that I don't have control over in Rust. I don't have any segfaults
(yet, perhaps), thanks to UBSAN and ASAN. I find Rust to have more impedance
than C on small applications, and this was indeed small.


#### Performance

Everything _except_ the latex to HTML is blazing fast. Unfortunately,
calling `hevea` is slow, so I implemented a caching mechanism to make using
`hevea` not-slow. `hevea` does not have an API, so I need to `fork` and
talk to its process which is understandably flow. I built a "key-value-store"
(read: serialize data into a file) with the stupidly-simple approach of writing
an append-only log into a file. `hevea` is a pure function conceptally,
since on providing the same latex input it's going to produce the same HTML
output, so it's perfectly safe to cache it:

```cpp
const char DB_PATH[]="./blogcache.txt";
unordered_map<ll, const char *> G_DB;
void loadDB() {
    G_DB = {};
    FILE *f = fopen(DB_PATH, "rb");
    ...
    while (!feof(f)) {
        ll k, len;
        fread(&k, sizeof(ll), 1, f); if (feof(f)) break;
        fread(&len, sizeof(ll), 1, f);
        ...
        char *buf = (char *)calloc(sizeof(char), len + 2);
        fread(buf, sizeof(char), len, f);
        ...
    }
    fclose(f);
};

const char *lookup_key(ll k) {
    unordered_map<ll, const char *>::iterator it = G_DB.find(k);
    if (it == G_DB.end()) { return nullptr; } return it->second;
};

void store_key_value(const ll k, KEEP const char *v, const ll len) {
    assert(G_DB.count(k) == 0);
    G_DB.insert(make_pair(k, strdup(v)));

    FILE *f = fopen(DB_PATH, "ab");
    assert(f != nullptr && "unable to open DB file");
    fwrite(&k, sizeof(ll), 1, f);
    fwrite(&len, sizeof(ll), 1, f);
    fwrite(v, sizeof(char), len, f);
    fclose(f);
}
```

#### For the future

I plan to rip out `hevea` and write my own `latex -> HTML` converter for
the _subset of LaTeX I actually use_. `hevea`'s strength is its downfall:
It can handle all of LaTeX, which means it's really slow. If I can concentrate
on a small subset, I don't need to play caching tricks, and I can likely
optimise the layout further for my use-cases.

I also want colored error messages, because who doesn't?

I'll probably gradually improve my static site generator over time. Once it's
at a level of polish where I'm happy with it, I'll spin it out as a separate
project.

#### Conclusions

Am I glad I did it? Yes, purely because my chunk of the internet aligns with
how I want it to be, and that makes me $\epsilon$ more happy.

I think of it as an investment into future me, since I can extend the
markdown and the transpiler in the way _I_ want it to be.

## [VC dimension](#vc-dimension)

Consider a ground set $X$. Let the space of all possible binary classifications
be the function space $C \equiv \{ f \mid f : X \rightarrow \pm 1 \}$.
Now, a hypothesis class $H$ is a subset of $C$. For example, some model
such as "return $+1$ if a point is inside a region, $-1$ otherwise" is a subset
of the full class $C$.

The VC dimension of $H$ measures how good $H$ is generating different classification.
We first need the notion of shattering to define this.

A subset $S \subseteq X$ of the ground set shatters a hypothesis class $H$
if the function $act_S$ has full range, where $act_S$ is defined as:

$$
act_S: H \rightarrow |S|^{\{0, 1\}}
act_S(h) = (h(s_0), h(s_1), h(s_2), \dots, h(s_n))
$$

That is, the hypothesis class $H$ can classify all the subsets of $S$.

Now the **VC dimension of the hypothesis class $H$ of a ground set $X$** is
the size of **largest possible $S \subseteq X$** such that $S$ is shattered
by $H$.

#### Correct interpretation
- We need _just one set_ $S$ of size $n$ to be shattered by $H$. We get
  to pick the set $S$.

#### Subtletly 1:
- We do not need _all sets_ of size $n$ to be shattered by $H$.

We **can** have the case where:

- All sets of size 3 are shattered by H
- Only one set of size 4 is shattered by H. All other sets of size 4 are not.
- Only one size of size 5 is shattered by H. All other sets of size 5 are not.
- No set of size 6 is shattered by H.

In this case, the VC dimension of $H$ is **5, not 3**.

#### Subtletly 2:

We **cannot** have the case where:
- All sets of size 3 are shattered by H
- No set of size 4 is shattered by H
- Some set of size 5 is shattered by H

For contradiction, let $S$ be the set of size $5$ that is shattered by $H$.
Let $T \subsetneq S$, $|T| = 4$. Now, $H$ shatters $T$ since $H$ shatters $S$.
Hence, Some set of size 4 has been shattered. Contradiction, since we assumed
that no set of size 4 is shattered by $H$.

So, to prove that sets of size $(\geq n)$ cannot be shattered, it suffices
to prove that sets of size equal to $n$ cannot be shattered.

#### Growth of number of sets shattered in $|S|$ for $S \subseteq X$ for a fixed $H$.

If we fix a hypothesis class $H$ for $X$, and we want to understand how $H$
varies over subsets of $X$, the idea is this:

Let $S$ be a set that is the maximum sized set that is shattered by $X$. ie,
$|S| = Vcdim(H)$ and $H$ shatters $S$.

Now, the idea is this:

- For subsets $T \subseteq S$, $|act_T(H)| = 2^{|T|}$ -- exponential.
- For subpersets $S \subsetneq Sup$, $|act_{Sup}(H) = Comb(|Sup|, |S)$ -- polynomial.

We can show that this exponential/polynomial behaviour happens in general
for $S \subseteq X$. 

#[Symplectic version of classical mechanics](#symplectic-version-of-classical-mechanics)

#### Basics, symplectic mechanics as inverting $\omega$:

I've never seen this kind of "inverting $\omega$" perspective written down
anywhere.  Most of them start by using the inteior product $i_X \omega$ without
ever showing where the thing came from. This is my personal interpretation of
how the symplectic version of classical mecanics comes to be.

If we have a non-degenerate, closed 
two-form $\omega: T_pM \times T_pM \rightarrow \mathbb R$.

Now, given a hamiltonian $H: M \rightarrow \mathbb R$, we can construct a
vector field $X_H: M \rightarrow TM$ under the definition:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{partially apply $\omega$ to see $\omega$ as a mapping from $T_p$ to $T_p^*M$} \\
&\omega2: T_p M \rightarrow T_p*M \equiv \lambda (v: T_p M). \lambda (w: T_p M) . \omega(v, w) \\
&\omega2^{-1}: T_p^*M \rightarrow T_p M; dH: M \rightarrow T_p* M \\
&X_H \equiv \lambda (p: M) \rightarrow \omega2^{-1} (dH(p)) \\
&(p: M) \xrightarrow{dH} dH(p) : T_p*M \xrightarrow{\omega2^{-1}} \omega2^{-1}(dH(p)): T_pM \\
&X_H = \omega2^{-1} \circ dH
\end{align*}
$$

This way, given a hamiltonian $H: M \rightarrow \mathbb R$, we can construct
an associated vector field $X_H$, in a pretty natural way.

We can also go the other way. Given the $X$, we can build the $dH$
under the equivalence:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\omega2^{-1} \circ dH  = X_H\\
&dH = \omega2(X_H) \\
&\int dH  = \int \omega2(X_H)  \\
&H = \int \omega2(X_H) 
\end{align*}
$$

This needs some demands, like the one-form $dH$ being integrable. But this
works, and gives us a bijection between $X_H$ and $H$ as we wanted.

We can also analyze the definition we got from the previous manipulation:
$$
\begin{align*}
&\omega2(X_H) =  dH \\
&\lambda (w: T_p M) \omega(X_H, w) = dH \\
&\omega(X_H, \cdot) = dH \\
\end{align*}
$$

We can take this as a _relationship_ between $X_H$ and $dH$. Exploiting
this, we can notice that $dH(X_H) = 0$. That is, moving along $X_H$ does
not modify $dH$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\omega2(X_H) =  dH \\
&\lambda (w: T_p M) \omega(X_H, w) = dH \\
&dH(X_H) = \omega(X_H, X_H) = 0 ~ \text{$\omega$ is anti-symmetric}
\end{align*}
$$

#### Preservation of $\omega$

We wish to show that $X_H^*(\omega) = \omega$. That is, pushing forward
$\omega$ along the vector field $X_H$ preserves $\omega$.

TODO.


#### Moment Map

Now that we have a method of going from a vector field $X_H$ to a Hamiltonian
$H$, we can go crazier with this. We can _generate vector fields_ using
Lie group actions on the manifold, and then look for hamiltonians corresponding
to this lie group. This lets us perform "inverse Noether", where for a given
choice of symmetry, we can find the Hamiltonian that possesses this symmetry.

We can create a map from the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g} \in \mathfrak{G}$ to
a vector field $X_{\mathfrak g}$, performing:

$$
\begin{align*}
&t : \mathbb R \mapsto e^{t\mathfrak g} : G \\
&t : \mathbb R \mapsto \phi(e^{t\mathfrak g}) : M \\
&X_{\mathfrak g} \equiv \frac{d}{dt}(\phi(e^{t\mathfrak g}))|_{t = 0}: TM
\end{align*}
$$

We can then attempt to recover a hamiltonian $H_{\mathfrak g}$ from
$X_{\mathfrak g}$. If we get a hamiltonian from this process, then it
will have the right symmetries.


## [Theorems for free](#theorems-for-free)

These are personal notes I made of a custom notation for denoting the relations
from the theorems for free paper. I developed the notation since I wanted
to keep track of what types are floating around and what the relations are doing.

We interpret types as sets.  If elements belong to the relation, ie, if `(a, a') ∈ R ⊂ AxA`,
we will denote this as `a[A -R- A']a'`. We will now write down some inference
rules:

1. We define `ReflB` as `a[Bool ReflB Bool]a`
2. We define `ReflI` as `i[Int ReflI Int]i`
3. The product of two relations `[A R B]`, `[X S Y]` is called as `RxS`,
   and is defined as: `(a,x)[AxX RxS BxY](b,y)` iff: `∀ abxy, a[A R B]b ∧ x[X S Y]y`.
4. The list space of a `[A R B]` is called `[A* [A R B] B*]`, 
   and is defined as: `la[A* [A R B] B*]lb` iff:
   `∀ la lb, |la| = |lb| ∧ (∀ i, la[i][A R B]lb[i])`
5. The function space of two relations`[A R B]`, `[X S Y]` is called `[A->X R->S B->Y]`,
   and is defined as: `f[A->X R->S B->Y]g` iff: `∀ a b, a[A R B]b => f(a)[X S Y]g(b)`.
6. The type family space of two relations is a function that takes
   a relation `[A R B]` and produces a new relation: 
   `g[FA | [A R B] | FB]h`. The relation takes as parameter a relation `[A R B]`
    for each choice.
7. The space of relations of `∀X.F(X)` is a relation defined by:
   `g[A->FA | ∀X.F(X) [FA [A R B] FB]| B->FB]h`
    `∀ A B R, (g A)[FA | [A R B] |  FB](h B)`.

#### Parametricity theorem

The parametricity thm states that for all terms `(r: R)`, we can deduce
`r[R rel(R) R]r` where `rel(R)` is the relation that fits the type, and is
derived from the above rules.

#### Parametricity for lists when the relation is a function:

The list space of a `[A R B]` is called `[A* [A R B] B*]`, 
and is defined as: `la[A* [A R B] B*]lb` iff:
- `∀ la lb, |la| = |lb| ∧ (∀ i, la[i][A R B]lb[i])`

Now, let us take a special case where `[A R B]` is a function `δ: A -> B`. That is:
- `a[A R B]b` iff `δ(a) = b`.

If this is the case, then we can simplify the math to be:

- `la[A* [A R B] B*]lb <=> ∀ la lb, |la| = |lb| ∧ (∀ i, la[i][A R B]lb[i])`
- `la[A* [A R B] B*]lb <=> ∀ la lb, |la| = |lb| ∧ (∀ i, δ(la[i]) = lb[i]`
- `la[A* [A R B] B*]lb <=> ∀ la lb, map δ la = lb`

#### Parametricity to prove rearrangements

- `r[∀ X. X* -> X*]r`
- `(r A)[A*->A*  | [A*->A* [A R B] B*->B*] |  B*->B*](r B)`
- `as[A* [A R B]  B*]bs => (r A as)[A* [A R B] B*](r B bs)`
- Pick `[A R B]` to be a _function_ `δ: A -> B`. Ie, `a[A R B]b` iff `δ(a) = b`.
- This lets us convert all occrences of `α[A R B]ω` into `ω = δ(α)`.
- Hence, `as[A* [A R B]  B*]bs` becomes `map δ as = bs`.
- Hence, `(r A as)[A* [A R B] B*](r B bs)` becomes `map δ (r A as) = (r B bs)`
- In toto, this let us replace `bs` with `map δ as`. We derive:
- `map δ (r A as) = (r B bs)`
- `map δ (r A as) = (r B (map δ as)`
- `map δ . (r A) = (r B) . map δ`
- Replace `bs[i]` with `δ(as[i])`to get result:
   `δ(r A as[i]) = r B δ(as[i])`, which was indeed what we were looking for.

## [How to reason with half-open intervals](#how-to-reason-with-half-open-intervals)

I've always found code that uses half-open intervals far harder to write
than using closed intervals. For example, when performing string processing,
I prefer to write `closed` over `halfopen` since I find it easier
to think about:

```cpp
void closed(int begin, int end, char *c) { //easier
  for(int i = begin; i <= end; ++i) {... }
}

void open(int begin, int len, char *c) { //harder
  for(int i = begin; i < begin + len; ++i) { ... }
}
```

However, I realised that by changing how I think about this to:

```cpp
void open(int begin, int len, char *c) { //harder
  for(int i = begin; i != begin + len; ++i)
}
```

It somehow made it way easier to grok.

- I had problems with `<` since I would
  mentally shift from `i < begin + len` to `i <= begin + len - 1`. Making
  this move would then make _all other reasoning_ harder, since I had
  keep switching between the `<` and `<=` point of view.

- On the other hand, when using `i != begin + len`, there was a single location
  to focus on: the point `begin + len`, and what happens when `i` reaches it.

Of course, this is old had to anyone who performs loop optimisatison: LLVM
internally converts most comparisons into the `a != b` form, because it's
easier to analyse. It took me this long it's easier for me to _think_
in this viewpoint as well.


## [How does one build a fusion bomb?](#how-does-one-build-a-fusion-bomb)

I haven't found anything on the internet that describes how to build
a fusion bomb; it's almost as if this information has been supressed
by governments. However, I'm curious --- would a physics grad student
studying nuclear physics or explosives have the theoretical know-how to
precisely build one, given the raw materials? Or is there some
"secret sauce" that's necessary?

I read on wikipedia that most countries classify the details:

> Detailed knowledge of fission and fusion weapons is classified to some
> degree in virtually every industrialized nation. In the United States,
> such knowledge can by default be classified as "Restricted Data",
> even if it is created by persons who are not government employees or
> associated with weapons programs, in a legal doctrine known as "born secret".

## [Christoffel symbols, geometrically](#christoffel-symbols-geometrically)

Suppose we have a manifold $M$. of dimension $d$ that has been embedded isometrically
into $\mathbb R^n$. So we have a function $e: \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$
which is the embedding. We will identify $M$ to be the subspace $Im(e)$.

Recall that $\partial_{x_i} e : \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$
is defined as:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\partial_{x_i}e : \mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb R^n \\
&[\partial {x_i}e](p) \equiv
 \lim_{\delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{e(p + (0:0, 1:0\dots, i:\delta_x, \dots, n:0)) - e(p)}{\delta x}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that it is a function of type $\mathbb R^d \rightarrow \mathbb R^n$.


- The tangent space at point $p \in Image(e)$ is going to be spanned by
  the basis $\{ \partial_{x_i}e \vert_p : \mathbb R^n \}$.
- The metric tensor of $M$,
 $g_{ij} \equiv \langle \frac{\partial e}{\partial x_i} \vert \frac{\partial e}{\partial x_j} \rangle$.
 That is, the metric tensor "agrees" with the dot product of the
 ambient space $\mathbb R^n$.
- A vector field $V$ on the manifold $M$ is by definition a combination of
  the tangent vector fields. $V(p_0) \equiv v^j(p_0) \partial_{x_j} e(p_0)$


We can calculate the derivaive of this vector field as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\frac{V(p)}{\partial x^i} \\
&= \partial_{x_i} \left[ v_j(p) \partial_{x_j} e \right]
&= v^j \cdot \partial_{x_i} \partial_{x_j} e + \partial_{x_j}e \cdot \partial_{x_i} v^j
\end{align*}
$$

We choose to rewrite the second degree term in terms of the tangent
space, and some component that is normal to us that we have no
control over.

$$
(\partial_{x_i} \partial_{x_j} e )(p) \equiv \Gamma^k_{ij} \partial_{x_k} e + \vec{n}
$$

This gives us the Christoffel symbols as "variation of second derivative _along_
the manifold.


#### Relationship to the Levi-Cevita connection

The covariant derivative defined by the Levi-Cevita connection is the derivative
that contains the projection of the full derivative in $\mathbb R^n$ onto
the tangent space $T_p M$. This is defined by the equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
 &\nabla_{e_i} V \equiv \partial_{x_i} V - \vec{n}  \\
 &= \Pi_{\vec{n}^\bot} \left [v^j \cdot \partial_{x_i} \partial_{x_j} e + \partial_{x_j}e \cdot \partial_{x_i} v^j \right] \\
 &= \Pi_{\vec{n}^\bot} \left[ v^j \cdot (\Gamma^k_{ij} \partial_{x_k} e + \vec{n})+ \partial_{x_j}e \cdot \partial_{x_i} v^j \right] \\
 &= v^j \cdot (\Gamma^k_{ij} \partial_{x_k} e + \vec 0) + \partial_{x_j}e \cdot \partial_{x_i} v^j \\
 &= v^j \cdot (\Gamma^k_{ij} \partial_{x_k} e + \vec 0) + \partial_{x_k}e \cdot \partial_{x_i} v^k \\
 &= v^j \cdot \Gamma^k_{ij} \partial_{x_k} e  + \partial_{x_k}e \cdot \partial_{x_i} v^k \\
 &= \partial_{x_k} e \left( v^j \cdot \Gamma^k_{ij}  + \partial_{x_i} v^k \right) \\
\end{align*}
$$

## [A natural vector space without an explicit basis](#a-natural-vector-space-without-an-explicit-basis)

On learning about infinite dimensional vector spaces, one learns that
we need to use the axiom of choice to assert that every such vector space
has a basis; indeed, it's equivalent to the AoC to assert this. However,
I had not known any "natural" examples of such a vector space till I studied
the proof of the barvinok algorithm. I produce the example here.

Consider a space such as $S \equiv \mathbb R^3$. Now, consider the vector
space spanned by the indicator functions of polyhedra in $S$. that's a mouthful,
so let's break it down.

A polyhedra is defined as a set of points that is defined by linear
inequalities: $P \equiv \{ x \in S : a_i \cdot x \leq b_i, i \in [1\dots n] \}$,
for all $a_i \in S$, $b \in \mathbb R$.

The indicator functions are of the form:

$$
[poly]: S \rightarrow \mathbb R;
[poly](x) \equiv
\begin{cases} 1 & x \in poly \\
0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
$$

we can define a vector space of these functions over $\mathbb R$, using
the "scaling" action as the action of $\mathbb R$ on these functions:


The vector space $V$ is __defined__ as the span of the indicator functions
of all polyhedra. It's clearly a vector space, and a hopefully intuitive
one. However, note that the set we generated this from (indicators of polyhedra)
don't form a basis since they have many linear dependencies between them.
For example, one can write the equation:

```
*---*   *-*   *-*   *
|###|   |#|   |#|   |
|###| = |#| + |#| - |
|###|   |#|   |#|   |
*---*   *-*   *-*   *
```


## [Cache oblivious B trees](#cache-oblivious-b-trees)

Central idea: assume a memory model where computation is free, only cost
is pulling data from cache into memory. Cache has total size $M$, can hold
blocks of size $B$. So it can hold $M/B$ blocks of main memory. Memory memory
has infinite size. Cost is number of transfers.

We assume that the algorithm _does not know M or B_. We assume that the cache
replacement strategy is optimal (kick out block that is going to be used
farthest in the future). This is an OK assumption to make since an LRU cache
using _twice_ the memory of a "oracular" cache performs equally well (citation?)


These data structures are cool since they essentially "Adapt" to varying cache
hierarchies and even multiple level cache hierarchies.

We study how to build cache-oblivious B-trees.

#### Building optimal cache-oblivious B trees to solve search

- We use a balanced BST. We want to find an order to store nodes in memory
  such that when we search for an element, we minimize number of blocks
  we need to pull in.
- All standard orders such as level order, pre-order, post-order fail.
- Corrrect order is "VEB (Van Em De Boas) order": carve a tree at the middle
  level of its edges. Layout a "triangle" or smaller collection
  of nodes linearly. Then Recursively layout the trees, linearly in memory.
- Supposedly if the number of nodes is $N$, we wil have roughly $\sqrt(N)$
  nodes on the top, and then $\sqrt(N)$ _triangles_ at the bottom.

#### Analysis Claim: we need to pull $O(\log_B N)$ blocks for any $B$ for any search query

$N$ is the number of nodes in the BST. Note that in the analysis, _we know what B is_,
even though the _algorithm does not_.

- We look at a particuar level of recursion. We will call it a "level of detail"
  straddling B.
- We will have large triangles of size $\geq B$, inside which there are smaller
  triangles of size $\leq B$ (reminds me of sierpinski).
- We know that the algorithm recursively lays it out, and triangle stores
  everything "inside" it _in a contiguous region_. So we stop at the
  requisite size where we know that the tree's triangles themselves
  contain triangles which fit into the block size.
- A little triangle of size less than B can live in at most two memory blocks
  by straddling a block boundary: by eg. having $(B-1)$ bits in one block
  and a single bit in another block.

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 <- index
|     |       | <- boundary
|-xxxxxxx-----| <-  data
```

- The question is that on a root-to-leaf bpath, how many such triangles do
  we need to visit. Since we repeatedly divide the nodes in half 
  _with respect to height_ until the little triangle has number of nodes less
  than $B$, the height is going to be $O(\log B)$ since it's still a binary tree.
- total height in $O(\log N)$.
- so height of "chunked tree" where we view each triangle as a single node
  is $\log N / \log B = \log_B n$.
- **insight**: ou data structure construction in some sense permits us to
  "binary search on $B$" since we divide the data structure into levels
  based on $B$. if $B = N$, then the full data structure fits into memory
  and we're good.

#### Black box: ordered file maintainince

We need a black box: ordered file maintainance (linked list for arrays)

- Store $n$ elements in specified order in an array of linear size $O(N)$.
  Array permits gaps.
- updates: delete element, insert elements between 2 elements.
- cannot do this in linear time, but we can move elements in an interval of
  size $\log^2(N)$ amortized.
- We need $O(1)$ scans for the data structure.

#### Next: _dynamic_ BST (inserts and deletes): layout

we take a VEB static tree on top of an ordered file. Tree is a segtree
that has max of nodes. Leaves are the members of the ordered file.

#### Updates

- search for node.
- update ordered file.
- propogate updates into the tree. This will have to be done in post-order
  because we need the leaves to be fixed before we can update the parent
  `max`.

#### Updates: analysis.

- look at level of detail that straddles $B$.
- Let us look at the bottom 2 levels.
- Note that when we perform post-order inside a triangle that has 3 triangles
  of size $\leq B$, we need to alternate between parent triangle and child triangle.
  Since the parent triangle is of size $\leq B$ and can therefore take
  at most $2B$ blocks of memory, similarly the child can take at most $2B$
  blocks of memory.
- So if our cache can hold $4$ blocks of memory, we're done.
  We won't need to kick anything out when performing the post-order
  traversal.
- For levels that are above the bottom 2 levels, we're still OK. there
  are not many triangles! / not many nodes! (`1:16:00` in the video)

## [Krohn-Rhodes decomposition](#krohn-rhodes-decomposition)

We denote partial functions with $X \rightharpoonup Y$ and total functions
with $X \rightarrow Y$.

A set $X$ equipped with a binary operator
$\star: X \times X \rightarrow X$ which is closed and associative
is a semigroup.

#### Partial function semigroup

For a ground set $X$, the set of partial functions $Pf(X) \equiv \{ f: X \rightharpoonup X \}$
along with function composition forms a semigroup. This is in fact stronger
than a semigroup. There exists:

- An identify function $e_x: X \rightarrow X; e_X(x) = x$
- A zero function $\theta_x: X \rightharpoonup X; \theta_x(x) = undef$, where by
  $undef$ we mean that it is _undefined_.

#### Transformation semigroup(TS)

Let $Q$ be a set. Let $S \subseteq Pf(Q)$ be a sub-semigroup of $Pf(Q)$.
Then the semigroup $X \equiv (Q, S)$ is called as the
 _transformation semigroup_(X) of states $Q$.

- The elements of $Q$ are called states of $X$
- while  the elements of $S$ are called  _actions_ of $X$.
- The set $Q$ itself is called as the _underlying set_ of $X$.
- For a fixed transformation semigroup $X$, we will write $Q_X$ and $S_X$
  to refer to its states and actions.


We call $X \equiv (Q, S)$ as a _transformation monoid_ if $S$ contains $1_Q(q) = q$.

##### Subtlety of being at transformation monoid.

There is some subttlety here. Just because $S$ is a monoid does not mean that
it that is a _transformation monoid_. It must have the identity element of
$Pf(Q)$ to be called a transformation monoid. For example, consider the
set $Q \equiv \\{ a, b \\}$ and the transformation semigroup $S \equiv \\{ f \equiv \alpha \mapsto b \\}$.
Now the set $S$ is indeed a monoid with identity element as $f: Q \rightarrow Q$.
however, $f \neq 1_Q$ , andh ence, $S$ is a not a _transformation monoid_.



##### Examples of transformation semigroups

1. $(X, \{ \theta(x) = undef \})$. The semigroup with the empty transformation.
2. $(X, \emptyset)$, the semigroup with _no_ transformations.


#### Semigroup action

We sometimes wish to represent a semigroup using an action/transformation semigroup
on a ground set $X$. So, given some semigroup $(T, \times)$ that needs to be represented,
if we can find a morphism $r: T \rightarrow Pf(X)$ ($r$ for representation)
such that:

- $ r(t_1 + t_2) = r(t_1) \circ r(t_2)$. [$r$ is a semigroup morphism].
- $t_1 \neq t_2 \implies \exists x \in X$ such that $r(t_1)(x) \neq r(t_2)(x)$.
  [Faithfulness].

Put more simply, $t_1 \neq t_2 \implies r(t_1) \neq r(t_2)$ where we define
function equality extensionally: $f = g \equiv \forall x, f(x) = g(x)$.


#### Embedding actions into the transformation semigroup
We often wish to represent some semigroup $S$ as the transformation semigroup
of some set of states $Q$. We can achieve this by proving a morphism:

- $r: S \rightarrow Pf(Q)$ that is faithful.

Then, we can treat elements of $S$ as elements of $Pf(Q)$.


#### Completion of a transformation semigroup

Given a transformation semigroup $X \equiv (Q, S)$ we can _complete_ it
by adding a new sink state $\bot$, and then converting all partial
functions in $S$ to total functions that transition to $\bot$. We have that
$\bot \cdot s = s \cdot \bot ~ \forall s \in S$.

We denote the completion as $X^c \equiv (Q^c, S^c)$.



#### Coverings

Let $X \equiv (Q_X, S_X)$ and $Y \equiv (Q_Y, S_Y)$ be transformation
semigroups. Let $\phi \subseteq Q_Y \times Q_X$ be a relation. Let $s_x \in S_X$
and $s_y \in S_Y$. Then, if the following diagram commutes:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
a & \rightarrow & b \\
\downarrow & & \downarrow \\
x & \rightarrow & y \\
\end{array}
$$

If $s_x(\phi(q_y)) = \phi(t_y(q_y))$, then we say that $t_y$ covers $s_x$ relative to $\phi$.
We imagine the $t_y$ lying above $s_x$, being projected down by $\phi$.

If a fixed $\phi$, for all $s_x \in S_X$ there exists a $t_y \in S_Y$ such that
$t$ covers $s$ relative to $\phi$, then we say that $\phi:$ is a 
_relation of automata_.

- If $\phi: Q_Y \rightarrow Q_X$ is surjective,
  then we say that $\phi$ is a __relational covering__ and write:

$$
X \triangleleft_{\phi} Y
$$

- If $\phi \subeteq Q_Y \times Q_X $ is _both_ surjective and partial,
  then we say that $\phi$ is a __covering__ and write:

$$
X \prec_\phi Y
$$

If $X \prec_\phi Y$, we say that $Y$ dominates $X$, or $Y$ covers $X$, or
$X$ divides $Y$.

#### Checking coverings and generating subsets

We note that for a given covering $\phi$, if $s_x$ is covered by $t_y$
and $p_x$ is covered by $q_y$, then $s_x \circ t_x$ is covered by $t_y \circ q_y$.

Thus, to check if $X$ is covered by $Y$, we simply need to check if 
__some generating subset of $X$ is covered by $Y$__.

#### Checking coverings of representations

Let us assume we have a representation of a transformation semigroup
given with a semigroup $\Sigma$, a transformation semigroup
$X \equiv (Q_X, S_X)$, and a representation $r: \Sigma \rightarrow S_X$ that is
faithful.

Now, to check that $X$ is covered by another $Y$, it suffices to check that
there exists a $t_y \in Y$ for each $\sigma \in X$ such that $r(\sigma)$ is
covered by this $t_y$.

#### Companion relation
Given a relation $\phi: Y \rightarrow X$, then we define:

$$
\Sigma \equiv \{ (s, t) : t \in T_Y \text{ covers } s \in S_X \}
$$

Recall compositions of elements are covered by a composition
of their coverings. Hence, if $(s, t), (s', t') \in \Sigma$, then
$(ss', tt') \in \Sigma$. thus, $\Sigma$ is a subsemigroup of $S_X \times S_Y$.

We can regard $\Sigma$ as the graph of a relation $\phi' \subseteq Q_Y \times Q_X$.
This will be called as __companion relation__ of $\phi$.

#### Wreath products

Let $X \equiv (Q_X, S_X)$ and $Y \equiv (Q_Y, S_Y)$. We're going to define a large
product $X \wr Y$.

We begn with the set $W \equiv S_X^Q_Y \times S_Y$, where
$S_X^Q_Y \equiv \{ f : Q_Y \rightarrow S_X \}$.
The wreath product then becomes:

$$
X \wr Y \equiv (Q_X \times Q_Y, W)
$$

with the action of $W$ on an element of $Q_X \times Q_Y$ being defined as:

$$
(f : Q_Y \rightarrow S_X, s_y : S_Y) (q_x : Q_X, q_Y : Q_Y) \equiv ( f(q_y)(q_x) , s_y (q_y))
$$

it's a "follow the types" sort of definition, where we edit the right component
as $r_y \mapsto t_y(r_y)$ since that's all we can do. In the case of
the left component, we have a $q_x$, and we need to produce another element
in $Q_X$, so we "must use $f$". The only way to use $f$ is to feed it
a $t_y$. This forces us into the above definition.


##### Composition of wreath products

To show that its closed under composition, let's consider $(f, s_y), (g, t_y) \in W$
with $f, g: Q_Yg \rightarrow S_X$, and $s_y, t_y \in S_Y$. The result is
going to be:

$$
(f, s_y)  (g, t_y) =  (\lambda q_y. f(q_y) \circ g(q_y), t_y \circ u_y)
$$

#### Equivalences of subsets of states

Let $X = (Q, S)$ be a transition system. Given subsets $(a, b, \subseteq Q)$,
we shall write $b \leq a$ if either $b \subseteq a$ or there exists some $s \in S$
such that $b \subseteq sa$, where $s(a) \equiv \{ s(a_i) : a_i \in a\}$. We can
define an equivalence relation $a \sim b \iff a \leq b \land b \leq a$.

**Note**: $ b \leq a \implies |b| \leq |a|$, since 
$b \leq a$ means that $b \subseteq s(a)$. Note that $s$ is actually a
function $s: Q \rightarrow Q$, and a function mapped over a set can only
ever decrease the number of elements in a set, since a function can only
xglomp elements together; it can never break an element apart into two.
Hence, $b \subseteq sa \subseteq a$, and thus $|b| \leq |a|$.


Similiarly, $a \leq b \implies |a| \leq |b|$. Therefore, $b \sim a$ means
that $|b| = |a|$.

**Theorem**: for all $a, b \in Q_X$ such that
$a ~ b$ such that $b \subseteq s(a)$, we show that $b = s(a)$, and there exists
a $t \in S_X$ such that $a = t(b)$.

**Proof**: Since $b \subseteq s(a) \subseteq a$ and $|b| = |a|$, $b = s(a)$.
Therefore $s$ is a permutation. Hence, $s$ is invertible and there exists
an inverse permutation $t$ such that $a = t(b)$. We now need to show that
$t \in S_X$. To do this, first note that if the order of the permutation
$s$ is $n$, then $t = s^{n-1}$, since $t \circ s = s^{n-1} \circ s = 1_S$.
Since the semigroup $S$ is closed under composition $t = s^{n-1}$ is in $S$,
since it is $s$ composed with itself  $(n-1)$ times.

#### Subset families of interest

We will be interest in a family of subsets of $Q_X$ called $A$, of the form:
- all sets of the form $s(Q)$ for all $s \in S_X$
- the set $Q$
- the empty set $\emptyset$
- all the singleton sets $\{ q \}$ for all $q \in Q$.

In the above set, we have $\leq$ and $\sim$ as defined above.

We note that the set $A$ is **closed under the action of all $s \in S_X$**.
For example, the empty set is taken to the empty set. All singleton
sets are taken to other singleton sets. For the full set $Q$, we add
the sets $s(Q)$ for all $s \in S_X$.

#### Height function

A height function for a transition system $X \equiv (Q_X, S_X)$ is a function
$h: A \rightarrow \mathbb Z$ such that:


1. $h(\emptyset) = -1$.
2. $h(\{ q \}) = 0 \forall q \in Q$.
3. $a \sim b \implies h(a) = h(b)$ for all $a, b \in A$.
4. $b < a \implies h(b) < h(a)$ for all $a, b \in A$.

The notation $b < a \equiv (b \leq a) \land \lnot (a \leq b)$.

(3) + (4) imply that two elements of the same height are either equivalent
or incomparable.

#### Pavings and bricks

for $a \in A$ such that $|a| > 1$, we denote by $B_a$ the set of all $b \in A$
what are maximal subsets of $a$. That is, if $b \in B_a$ then $b \subsetneq a$,
and $\not \exists c, b \subsetneq c \subsetneq a$. Equivalently, if there
exists a $c$ such that $b \subseteq c \subseteq a$, then $b = c$ or $b = a$.

Note that we can assert that $a = \cup_{b \in B_a} b$. This is because $B_a$
contains all the singletons of $Q_X$. so we can begin by writing $a$ as
a union of singletons, and then merging elements of $B_a$ into larger elements
of $B$, terminating when we cannot merge any more elements of $B_a$.

- The set $B_a$ is called as the **paving of $a$**.
- The elements of $B_a$ are called as the **bricks of $a$**.

#### Group of permutations for $a \in A$

Let us assume that there exists a $s \in S$ such that $s(a) = a$. Let $A_a$
be the set of all elements in $A$ contained in $a$:
$A_a = \{ A_i : A_i \in A, A_i \subseteq a \}$.

Recall that the set $A$ was closed under the action of all $s$, and hence,
since $s$ is a permutation of $a$, this naturally extends into a
permutation of $A_a$: $s A_a = A_a$. Now note that this induces a permutation
of the set $B_a$. This creates a transition system:

$$
\begin{align*}
&G_a \equiv \{ s \in S : s a = a \} \\
&H_a \equiv (B_a, G_a) \\
\end{align*}
$$

We have already shown how if $s \in S$ defines a permutation of some set $X$
by its action, then its inverse also exists in $S$. So, this means that
$G_a$ is in fact a transition _group_ that acts on $B_a$.

It might turn out that $G_a = \emptyset$. However, if $G_a \neq \emptyset$,
then as stated above, $G_a$ is a group.

We will call such a transition group a **generalized transition group**, since
either $G_a = \emptyset$ or $G_a$ is a group.


Now, the generalized transition group $H_a$ is called as the
**holonomy transition system** of $a$, and the group $G_a$ is called as
the **holonomy group** of $a$.


We have that $G_a \prec S$ since $G_a$ is a quotient of the sub-semigroup
$\{ s | s \in S, as = a \}$. (TODO: so what? why does this mean that it's $\prec$?)

**Theorem:** if $a \sim b$, then $H_a \simeq H_b$
  (similar subsets have isomorphic holonomy transition systems).
**Proof:** Let us assume that $a \neq b$. since $a \sim b$, we have elements
of the form $s, s^{-1} \in S$ such that $b = s(a)$, $a = s^{-1}(b)$.

Recall that for $b_a \in B_a$ is such that for a member $g \in G_a$,
$g(b_a) = b_a$. $B_b$ must have the element $s(b_a)$. [TODO!]

#### Holonomy decomposition

Let $X \equiv (Q, S)$ be a transition system and let $h$ be a height
function for $X$, such that $h(Q) > 0$. For a fixed $i$,
let $a_1, a_2, \dots a_k$ be the representatives of equivalence classes of
elements of $A$ of height equal to $i$. We define:

$$
H_i^\lor \equiv H_{a_1} \lor H_{a_2} \dots \lor H_{a_n}
$$


#### Inductive hypothesis for coverings

We will say a relational covering $X \triangleleft_{\phi} Y$ is **of rank $i$**
with respect to a given height function $h$ if $\phi$ relates states in $Y$
to subsets of states in $x$ that are members of $A$ and have rank at most i.
Formally, for each $p \in Q_Y$, we have that $\phi(p) \in A$ and$h(\phi(p)) \leq i$.


We prove that if $X \triangleleft_{\phi} Y$ is a relational covering of rank $i$,
then $X \triangleleft_{\phi} \overbar{H_i^\lor} \wr Y$ is a relational covering
of rank $i - 1$.

The proof is a proof by induction.

##### Base case:

Start with the relational covering with $Q_Y = \{ 0 \}, S_Y = \{ id \}$,
and the cover $\phi(0) = Q_X$. Clearly, this has rank $n$ since the height
of $Q_X$ is $n$, and $\phi$ is inded a covering, since the only transition
that $Y$ can make (stay at the same state) is simulated by any transition
in $S_X$ [TODO: is this really the argument?]

For induction, assume $X \triangleleft_{\phi} Y$ is a relational covering of rank $i$
with respect to some height function $h$. $X\equiv (Q_X, S_X)$ and
$Y \equiv (Q_Y, S_Y)$. We define
- $QY_i \equiv \{ q_y : q_y \in Q_Y, h(\phi(q_y)) = i \}$
- $QY_< \equiv \{ q_y : q_y \in Q_Y, h(\phi(q_y)) < i \}$


We know that $A$ contains elements of height exactly $i$. Let $a_1, a_2, \dots a_k$
be representatives of sets of of height $i$ in $A$. Thus, for each $qy_i \in QY_i$,
we have that:

- $\phi(qy_i) = a_j$ for a **unique** $1 \leq j \leq k$.
- We select elements $u, \overline{u} \in S$ such that $u(\phi(qy_i)) = a_j$
  and $\overline{u}(a_j) = \phi(qy_i)$.

We will show how to establish a relational covering:
- $X \triangleleft_{\phi} \wr \overbar{H_i^\lor} Y$ using a relation:
- $\phi \subseteq [(B_{a_1} \cup B_{a_2} \cup \dots B_{a_k})\times Q_Y ] \times Q_X$

## [Proving block matmul using program analysis](#proving-block-matmul-using-program-analysis)

It's a somewhat well-known fact that given matrix multiplication: $O = AB$
where $O \in \mathbb R^{2n \times 2m}$ ($O$ for output),
$A \in \mathbb R^{2n \times r}, B \in \mathbb R^{r \times 2m}$ are matrices.

We can also write this as follows:

$$
\begin{bmatrix} o_{11} & o_{12} \\ o_{21} & o_{22} \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} b_{11} + a_{12} b_{21} & a_{11} b_{12} + a_{12} b_{22} \\
a_{21} b_{11}+ a_{22} b_{21} & a_{21} b_{12} + a_{22} b_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

When written as code, the original matrix multiplication is:

```cpp
// a:[2N][2Z] b:[2Z][2M] -> out:[2N][2M]
int matmul(int N, int Z, int M, int a[N][Z], int b[Z][M], int out[N][M]) {
  for(int i = 0; i < 2*N; ++i) {
    for(int j = 0; j < 2*M; ++j) {
      for(int k = 0; k < 2Z; ++k) out[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]
    }
  }
}
```

and the block-based matrix multiplication is:

```cpp
// a:[2N][2Z] b:[2Z][2M] -> out:[2N][2M]
int matmulBlock(int N, int Z, int M, int a[N][Z], int b[Z][M], int out[N][M]) {
  for (int BI = 0; BI < 2; ++BI) {
    for (int BJ = 0; BJ < 2; ++BJ) {
      for(int i = BI*N; i < BI*N+N; ++i) {
        for(int j = BJ*M; j < BJ*M+M; ++j) {
          for(int k = 0; k < 2Z; ++k) { out[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j] }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

we wish to show that both of these programs have the _same semantics_.
We will do this by appealing to ideas from program analysis.

#### The key idea

We will consider the statement:

```cpp
out[i][j] += a[i][k] * b[k][j]
```

as occuring at an abstract "point in time" $(i, j, k)$ in the `matmul` function.
I also occurs at an abstract "point in time" $(BI, BJ, i', j', k')$ in
the `matmulBlock` function.

We will then show that the loops `for(i...) for(j...) for(k...)` are fully
parallel, and hence we can reorder the loops any way we want.

Then, we will show that the ordering imposed by $(BI, BJ, i', j', k')$
is a reordering of the original $(i, j, k)$ ordering. We do this by
showing that there is a bijection:

$$
(i=i_0, j=j_0, k=k_0) \rightarrow (BI=i_0/N, BJ=j_0/N, i=i_0\%N, j=j_0\%N, k=k_0)
$$

Thus, this bijection executes all loops, and does so without affecting the
program semantics.

#### Schedules

We'll zoom out a little, to consider some simple programs and understan
how to represent parallelism.

```cpp
void eg1(int N, int M, int out[N][M]) {
for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
  for(int j = 1; j < M; ++j) {
    out[i][j] = out[i][j-1];
  }
}
```

Notice that this program is equivalent to the program with the $i$ loop
reversed:

```cpp
void eg1rev(int N, int M, int out[N][M]) {
for(int i = N-1; i >=0; --i) {
  for(int j = 1; j < M; ++j) {
    out[i][j] = out[i][j-1];
  }
}
```

What's actually _stopping_ us from reversing the loop `for(j...)`? it's
the fact that the value of, say, `out[i=0][j=1]` _depends_ on
`out[i=0][j=0]`. We can see that in general, `out[i=i_0][j=j_0]` _depends_
on `out[i=i_0][j=j_0-1]`. We can represent this by considering a
_dependence set_:

$$
\{ \texttt{write}:(i_0, j_0-1) \rightarrow \texttt{write}:(i_0, j_0) \}
$$

in general, we can reorder statements as long as we do not change
the _directions_ of the arrows in the dependence set.

## [Why I like algebra over analysis](#why-i-like-algebra-over-analysis)

Midnight discussions with my room-mate
[Arjun P](https://researchweb.iiit.ac.in/~arjun.p/).

This tries to explore what it is about algebra that I find appealing.

I think the fundamental difference to me comes down to flavour ---
analysis and combinatorial objects feel very "algorithm", while Algebra feels
"data structure".

To expand on the analogy, a proof technique is like an algorithm, while an
algebraic object is like a data structure. The existence of an algebraic object
allows us to "meditate" on the proof technique as a separate object that does
not move through time. This allows us to "get to know" the algebraic object,
independent of how it's used. So, at least for me, I have a richness of
feeling when it comes to algebra that just doesn't shine through with analysis.
The one exception maybe reading something like "by compactness", which has
been hammered into me by exercises from Munkres :)

Meditating on a proof technique is much harder, since the proof technique
is necessarily intertwined with the problem, unlike a data structure which
to some degree has an independent existence.


This reminds me of the quote: "“Art is how we decorate space;
Music is how we decorate time.”. I'm not sure how to draw out the
tenuous connection I feel, but it's there.

Arjun comes from a background of combinatorics, and my understanding of his
perspective is that each proof is a technique unto itself. Or, perhaps
instantiating the technique for each proof is difficult enough that abstracting
it out is not useful enough in the first place.

A good example of a proof technique that got studied on its own right in
combinatorics is the probabilistic method. A more reasonable example is that of
the Pigeonhole principle, which still requires insight to instantiate in
practise.

Not that this does not occur in algebra either, but there is something in
algebra about how just meditating on the definitions. For example,
Whitney trick that got pulled out of the proof of the Whitney embedding
theorem.

To draw an analogy for the haskellers, it's the same joy of being able to write
down the type of a haskell function and know exactly what it does, enough that
a program can automatically derive the function (djinn). The fact that we know
the object well enough that just writing the type down allows us to infer the
_program_, makes it beautiful. There's something very elegant about the
_minimality_ that algebra demands. Indeed, this calls back to another quote:
"perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there
is nothing left to take away".

I'm really glad that this 2 AM discussion allowed me to finally pin down
why I like algebra.

## [`using` for cleaner function type typedefs](#using-for-cleaner-function-type-typedefs)

I've always struggled with remembering the syntax for function type typedefs:

```cpp
typedef RETTY (*FNTYNAME)(ARGTY1, ARGTY2, ..., ARGTYn);
```

we can now use `using` for a far more pleasant syntax:

```cpp
using FNTYNAME = RETTY(ARGTY1, ARGTY2, ..., ARGTYn);
```

which is also intuitive. You write down the "type"
on the right hand side, and give it a name on the left.

This is not strictly the same, since the `typedef`
`typedefs` `FNTYNAME` to a _function pointer type_, while
the C++ version typedefs the _function type_. I prefer
the latter at any rate, since I dislike the fact
that the usual typedef tends to hide the fact that a
function pointer is some pointer-like-thing.

the [Ocaml-git](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-git/) project is a
re-implementation of `git` in `OCaml`. It's well-written, and I was
walking through the codebase, when I found absolutely amazing, hilarious,
and deep comments from `dinosaure`. I really enjoyed reading through the
codebase, and the existence of these comments made it more humane to read.
I don't know who `dinosaure` is, but I'm really glad they wrote the comments
they did, it really made my day.

En gros, [Helper.MakeDecoder] utilise ce buffer comme buffer interne

Il s'agit de connaître la véritable taille du [Bigarray] et de

Avant, cette modification, [zl], [de] et [io] partagaient le même
[Bigarray] découpé (avec [Cstruct]) en 3. Donc, dans le
[MakeDecoder], [refill] considérait (pour des gros fichiers faisant
plus de 0x8000 bytes) que après [de], nous avions encore de la

Ainsi, on [blit]ait [zl] dans [de+sizeof(de) == io], et finalement,
on se retrouvait à essayer de décompresser ce que nous avions
décompressé. (YOLO).
Donc, on considère maintenant [de] comme un [Cstruct.t] et un

Cependant, il faudrait continuer à introspecter car j'ai

## [How to link against MLIR with CMake](#how-to-link-against-mlir-with-cmake)

Since `MLIR` hasn't setup the nice tooling that LLVM has around `CMake`
as far as I can tell, one needs to actually _know_ `CMake` to link against
`MLIR`. However, as is well known, `CMake` incantations are handed down
by preists who spend the better part of their lives studying the tome
that is the CMake manual. I, an unlucky soul had to go on this adventure,
and I hope to spare you the trouble.

I wished to link against a static library build of MLIR. The secret
lies in the `find_library` call:

```
#If the variable has been set by -DMLIR_INCLUDE_PATH, then keep it.
#Otherwise fallback to the environment variable $MLIR_INCLUDE_PATH.
#if neither, then *shrug*.
IF(NOT MLIR_INCLUDE_PATH)
    set (MLIR_INCLUDE_PATH $ENV{MLIR_INCLUDE_PATH})
endif()

#Resolve for:
#- a library target called `MLIRAnalysis`

## [Energy as triangulaizing state space](#energy-as-triangulaizing-state-space)

This comes from The wild book by John Rhodes, which I anticipate I'll be posting more of in the coming weeks.

#### Experiments

Let an experiment be a tuple of the phase space $X$, action space $A$,
and an action of the actions onto the phase space
$\curverightarrow: A \times X \rightarrow X$. We will write
$x' = a \curverightarrow x$ to denote the new state of the system
$x$. So the experiment $E$ is the data
$E \equiv (X, A, \curverightarrow : A \times X \rightarrow X)$.

#### Coordinate systems.

The existence of the action $\curverightarrow$ allows us to
write the evolution of the system recursively:

$x_{t+1} = a \rightarrow x_t$.

However, to understand the final state $x_{t+1}$, we need to essentially
"run the recursion", which does not permit us to 
_understand the experiment_.

What we really need is the ability to "unroll" the loop. To quote:

> Informally, understanding an experiment $E$ means
> introducing coordinates into phase space of $E$ which are in triangular form
> under the action of the inputs of $E$.

#### Conservation laws as triangular form

We identify certain interesting invariants of a system by two criteria:

1. The parameter $Q(t)$ determines some obviously important aspects of
   the system. That is, there is a deterministic function $M(Q(t))$ which
   maps $Q(t)$ to "measure" some internal state of the system.
2. If the values of such a  parameter $Q$ is known at time $t_0$ (denoted $Q(t_0)$)
    and it is also known what inputs are presented to the
    system from time $t$ to time $t + \epsilon$
    (denoted $I[t_0, t_0 + \epsilon]$), then the new value of $Q$ is a
    deterministic function of $Q(t_0)$ and $I[t_0, t_0+ \epsilon]$.


Such parameters allow us to understand a system, since they are deterministic
parameters of the evolution of the system, while also provding a way to
measure some internal state of the system using $M$.

For example, consider a system $x$ with an energy function $e(x)$. If we
perform an action $a$ on the system $x$, then we can predict the action
$e(x' = a \curvearrowright x)$ given just $e(x)$ and $a$ --- here,
$(x' = a \curverightarrow x)$ is the action of the system $a$ on $x$.

> In general, conservation principles give a first coordinate
> of a triangularization. In the main a large part of physics can be viewed as
> discovering and introducing functions $e$ of the states $q$ of the
> system such that under action $a$, $e(a \curverightarrow q)$ depends
> only on $e(q)$ and $a$, and **not** on $q$.


#### Theory: semidirect and wreath products

- For semidirect products, I refer you to
    [the cutest way to write semidirect products](#the-cutest-way-to-write-semidirect-products)
    [Line of investigation to build physical intuition for semidirect products](#line-of-investigation-to-build-physical-intuition-for-semidirect-products).

#### Symmetries as triangular form

> We first heuristically indicate the construction involved in going from the
> group of symmetries to the triangularization, and then precisely write it out
> in all pedantic detail.

Let an experiment be $E \equiv (X, A, \curverightarrow)$. Then we define $\Pi$
is a _symmetry_ of $E$ iff:

1. $\Pi: X \rightarrow X$ is a permutation of $X$.
2. $\Pi$ commutes with the action of each $a$:
       $ \Pi(a \curverightarrow x) = a \curverightarrow \Pi(x) $.

We say that the theory $E$ is _transitive_ (in the action sense) if for
all $x_1, x_2 \in X, x_1 \neq x_2$, there exists $a_1, a_2, \dots a_n$
such that $ x_2 = a_n \curverightarrow \dots (a_1 \curverightarrow x_1) $.

Facts of the symmetries of a system:

1. We know that the symmetries of a theory $E$ form a group.
2. If $E$ is transitive, then each symmetry $\Pi$ is a regular permutation
   --- If there exists an $x$ such that $\Pi(x_f) = x_f$ (a fixed point), then
   this implies that $\Pi(x) = x$ for _all_ $x$.
3. Let the action split $X$ into disjoint orbits $O_1, O_2, \dots O_k$ from whom
   we choose representatives $x_1 \in O_1, x_2 \in O_2, \dots x_k \in O_k$.
   Then, if $E$ is transitive, there is _exactly one_ action that sends a
   particular $x_i$ to a particular $x_j$. So, on fixing _one component_
   of an action, we fix _all components_.

To show that this gives rise to a triangulation, we first construct
a semigroup of the actions of the experiment:
$S(E) \equiv \{ a_1 \dots a_n : n \geq 1 \text{~and~} a_i \in A \}$.

Now, let $G = Sym(E)$, the full symmetry group of $E$. One can apparently
express the symmetry group in terms of:

$$(X, S) \leq (G, G)  \wr (\{ O_1, O_2, \dots O_k\}, T)$$


## [The cutest way to write semidirect products](#the-cutest-way-to-write-semidirect-products)

Given two monoids $(M, +, 0_M)$ and $(N, \times, 1_N)$, and a
homomorphism $\phi: N \rightarrow End(M)$, where $End(M)$
is the endomorphism group of $M$. We will notate $\phi(n)(m)$ as $n \cdot m \in M$.

Now the semidirect product $M \ltimes_\phi N$ is the set $M \times N$ equipped
with the multiplication rule:

- $(m, n) (m', n') = (m + n \cdot m', nn')$

This can also be written down as:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\ m & n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\ m' & n'
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\ m + n \cdot m' & n \times n'
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This way of writing down semidirect products as matrices makes many things
immediately clear:

- The semidirect product is some kind of "shear" transform, since that's
  what a shear transformation looks like, matrix-wise.
- The resulting monoid $M \ltimes_{\phi} N$ has identity $(0_M, 1_N)$,
  since for the matrix to be identity, we need the 2nd row to be $(0, 1)$.
- The inverse operation if $(M, N)$ were groups would have to be such that

$$
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ m + n \cdot m' & n \times n' \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

Hence:
- $nn' = 1$ implies that $n' = 1/n$.
- $m + n m' = 0$ implies that $m' = -m/n$.

which is indeed the right expression for the inverse.



## [My Favourite APLisms](#my-favourite-aplisms)

#### identity matrix
```
n←3 ⋄ id ← n n ⍴(1,n⍴0) ⋄ id
```

This relies heavily on `⍴` replicating its arguments.


#### histogram
```
xs←(1 1 3 3 3 6) ⋄ n←(⌈/xs)⍴0 ⋄ n[xs]+←1 ⋄ n
```

The use of `n[x] +←1` will stably write `+1` as many times as there are repeated
indexes in `xs`.

## [Proof of chinese remainder theorem on rings](#proof-of-chinese-remainder-theorem-on-rings)

#### General operations on ideals
We have at our hands a commutative ring $R$, and we wish to study the ideal
structure on the ring. In particular, we can combine ideals in the following
ways:

1. $I + J \equiv \{ i + j : \forall i \in I, j \in J \}$
2. $I \cap J \equiv \{ x : \forall x \in I \land x \in J \}$
3. $I\oplus J \equiv \{ (i, j) : \forall i \in I \land j \in J \}$
4. $IJ \equiv \{ ij : \forall i \in I \land j \in J \}$

We have the containment:

$$
IJ \subseteq I \cap J \subseteq I, J \subseteq I + J \subseteq R
$$

#### $IJ$ is a ideal, $IJ \subseteq I \cap J$

it's not immediate from the definition that $IJ$ is an ideal. The idea is
that given a sum $\sum_k i_k j_k \in IJ$, we can write each $i_k j_k = i'_k$,
since the ideal $I$ is closed under multiplication with $R$. This gives
us $\sum i'_k = i'' \in I$. Similarly, we can interpret $\sum_k i_k j_k = \sum_k j'_k = j''k \in J$.

Hence, we get the containment $IJ \subseteq I \cap J$.

#### $I \cap J subseteq I$, $I \cap J \subseteq J$

Immediate from the inclusion function.

#### $I, J \subseteq I + J$

Immediate from inclusion

#### CRT from an exact sequence

There exists an exact sequence:

$$
\begin{align*}
0 \rightarrow I \cap J \xrightarrow{f} I \oplus J \xrightarrow{g} I + J \rightarrow 0 \\
&f(r) = (r, r) \\
&g((i, j)) = i + j
\end{align*}
$$

We are forced into this formula by considerations of dimension. We know:

$$
\begin{align*}
&dim(I \oplus J) = dim(I) + dim(J) \\
&dim(I + J) = dim(I) + dim(J) - dim(I \cap J) \text{[inclusion-exclusion]} \\
&dim(I + J) = dim(I \oplus J) - dim(I \cap J) \\
&dim(I + J) - dim(I \oplus J) + dim(I \cap J) = 0\\
&V - E + F = 2
\end{align*}
$$

By analogy to euler characteristic which arises from homology, we need to have
$I \oplus J$ in the middle of our exact sequence. So we must have:

$$
0 \rightarrow ? \rightarrow I \oplus J \rightarrow ?\rightarrow 0
$$

Now we need to decide on the relative ordering between $I \cap J$ and $I + J$.
- There is  no _universal_ way to send $I oplus J \rightarrow I \cap J$. It's
  an unnatural operation to restrict the direct sum into the intersection.
- There is a _universal_ way to send $I \oplus J \rightarrow I + J$: sum
  the two components. This can be seen as currying the addition operation.

Thus, the exact sequence _must_ have $I + J$ in the image of $I \oplus J$. This
forces us to arrive at:

$$
0 \rightarrow I \cap J \rightarrow I \oplus J \rightarrow I + J \rightarrow 0
$$

The product ideal $IJ$ plays no role, since it's not possible to define a 
product of modules _in general_ (just as it is not possible to define
a product of vector spaces). Thus, the exact sequence better involve
module related operations.  We can now recover CRT:

$$
\begin{align*}
0 \rightarrow I \cap J \xrightarrow{f} I \oplus J \xrightarrow{g} I + J \rightarrow 0 \\
0 \rightarrow R \xrightarrow{f} R \olpus R \xrightarrow{g} R \rightarrow 0 \\
0 \rightarrow R / (I \cap J) \rightarrow R/I \oplus R /J \rightarrow R/(I + J) \rightarrow 0
\end{align*}
$$

## [monic and epic arrows](#monic-and-epic-arrows)

This is trivial, I'm surprised it took me _this long_ to internalize this fact.

When we convert a poset $(X, \leq)$ into a category, we stipulate that
$x \rightarrow y \iff x \leq y$.

If we now consider the category $Set$ of sets and functions between sets,
and arrow $A \xrightarrow{f} B$ is a function from $A$ to $B$. If $f$ is
monic, then we know that $|A| = |Im(f)| \leq |B|$. That is, a monic arrow
behaves a lot like a poset arrow!

Similarly, an epic arrow behaves a lot like the arrow in the inverse poset.
I wonder if quite a lot of category theoretic diagrams are clarified by thinking
of monic and epic directly in terms of controlling sizes.

## [The geometry of Lagrange multipliers](#the-geometry-of-lagrange-multipliers)
If we want to minise a function $f(x)$ subject to the constraints $g(x) = c$,
one uses the method of lagrange multipliers. The idea is to consider a new
function $L(x, \lambda) = f(x) + \lambda (c - g(x))$. Now, if one has a local maxima
$(x^\star, y^\star)$, then the conditions:

1. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 0$: $f'(x^\star) - \lambda g'(x^\star) = 0$.
2. $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = 0$: $g(x^\star) = c$.

Equation (2) is sensible: we want our optima to satisfy the constraint that
we had originally imposed. What is Equation (1) trying to say?
Geometrically, it's asking us to keep $f'(x^\star)$ parallel to $g'(x^\star)$.
Why is this a good ask?

Let us say that we are at an $(x_0)$ which is a feasible point ($g(x_0) = c$).

We are interested in wiggling
$(x_0) \xrightarrow{wiggle} (x_0 + \vec\epsilon) \equiv x_1$.

- $x_1$ is still feasible: $g(x_1) = c = g(x_0)$.
- $x_1$ is an improvement: $f(x_1) > f(x_0)$.

- If we want $g(x_1)$ to not change, then we need $g'(x_0) \cdot \vec \epsilon = 0$.
- If we want $f(x_1)$ to be larger, we need $f'(x_0) \cdot \vec \epsilon > 0$.

If $f'(x_0)$ and $g'(x_0)$ are parallel, then attempting to improve $f(x_0 + \vec \epsilon)$
by change $g(x_0 + \vec \epsilon)$, and thereby violate the constraint
$g(x_0 + \episilon) = c$.

## [Efficient tree transformations on GPUs](#efficient-tree-transformations-on-gpus)

All material lifted straight from [Aaron Hsu's PhD thesis](https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/24749). I'll be converting
APL notation to C++-like notation.


#### Tree repsentation as multi-dimensional ragged nested arrays

We're interested in this tree:
```
      ∘
┌──┬──┴────┐
a  b       c
│ ┌┴┐  ┌───┼───┐
p q r  s   t   u
  │    │   |
  │   ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐
  v   w x y z
```

I'll be writing APL commands in front of a `$` to mimic bash, and I'll
write some arrays as multi-line. To run them, collapse them into a single
line. The `ast` object is represented in memory as:
```
$ ast ← ('∘'
           ('a' ('p'))
           ('b'
             ('q' ('v'))
             ('r'))
           ('c'
             ('s' ('w' 'x'))
             ('t' ('y' 'z'))
             ('u')))
$ ]disp ast
┌→┬──┬────────┬───────────────────┐

│ │  │        │└─┴─────→┴─────→┴─┘│
└─┴─→┴───────→┴──────────────────→┘
```

Here's how read the array representation. Look at the top level of the tree.
we have a root node with three children:

```
      ∘
┌──┬──┴────┐
a  b       c

┌→┬──┬────────┬─────────────┐
│∘│  │        │             │
│ │ a│   b    │     c       │
│ │  │        │             │
└─┴─→┴───────→┴────────────→┘
```

With the first `∘` being the root node, and the three adjacent cells
being the children.

Next, we look at how `x` is represented. This is predictably recursive. Let's
see the subtree under `x`:

```
      ∘
┌──┬──┴────┐
a  b       c
│
p

┌→┬──┬────────┬─────────────┐
│∘│ap│        │             │
│ │  │  b     │   c         │
│ │  │        │             │
└─┴─→┴───────→┴────────────→┘

```

Similarly for `y`:

```
      ∘
┌──┬──┴────┐
a  b       c
│ ┌┴┐
p q r

┌→┬──┬────────┬─────────────┐
│∘│ap│┌→┬──┬─┐│             │
│ │  ││b│q │r││   c         │
│ │  │└─┴─→┴─┘│             │
└─┴─→┴───────→┴────────────→┘
```

And so on, leading to the final representation:

```
      ∘
┌──┬──┴────┐
a  b       c
│ ┌┴┐  ┌───┼───┐
p q r  s   t   u
  │    │   |
  │   ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐
  v   w x y z
┌→┬──┬────────┬───────────────────┐
│∘│ap│┌→┬──┬─┐│┌→┬──────┬──────┬─┐│

│ │  │        │└─┴─────→┴─────→┴─┘│
└─┴─→┴───────→┴──────────────────→┘
```


Note that for this representation to work, we need to be able to:

- nest arrays inside arrays.
- have subarrays of different sizes (ragged arrays)
- of different _nesting depths_ --- so it's really not even an array?

I don't understand the memory layout of this, to be honest. I feel like to
represent this in memory would still rely on pointer-chasing, since we need
to box all the arrays. This is possibly optimised by APL to not be too bad.

#### The depth vector representation

```
      ∘             0
┌──┬──┴────┐
a  b       c        1
│ ┌┴┐  ┌───┼───┐
p q r  s   t   u    2
  │    │   |
  │   ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐
  v   w x y z       3
```

If we visit this tree and record depths in pre-order `(node left right)`, we
arrive at the list:

```
(∘:0
  (a:1 (p:2)) (b:1 (q:2 (v:3)) (r:2))
  (c:1 (s:2 (w:3 x:3)) (t:2 (y:3 z:3)) (u:2)))
```

formatted as:

```
(∘:0
  (a:1
    (p:2))
  (b:1
    (q:2 (v:3))
    (r:2)
  )
  (c:1 (s:2 (w:3 x:3))
       (t:2 (y:3 z:3))
       (u:2))
)
```

This linearlized is the list:

```
    (∘ a p b q v r c s w x t y z u)
d ← (0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2)

      ∘             0
┌──┬──┴────┐
a  b       c        1
│ ┌┴┐  ┌───┼───┐
p q r  s   t   u    2
  │    │   |
  │   ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐
  v   w x y z       3
```


To convert the `ast` object into a depth vector representation, we can
use the following call:

```
$ ast ← ('∘' ('a' ('p')) ('b' ('q' ('v')) ('r')) ('c' ('s' ('w' 'x')) ('t' ('y' 'z')) ('u')))
$ d ← ∊0{(⊢,(⍺+1)∇⊣)/⌽⍺,1↓⍵}ast
0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2
```

Let's break this down:

TODO

#### Inverted tables

We represent data associated with our nodes as follows:

```
$ data ← ⍪ ¨d(15⍴'T')(↑15⍴⊂'n.')
$ ]disp data
┌→┬─┬──┐
│0│T│n.│
│1│T│n.│
│2│T│n.│
│1│T│n.│
│2│T│n.│
│3│T│n.│
│2│T│n.│
│1│T│n.│
│2│T│n.│
│3│T│n.│
│4│T│n.│
│2│T│n.│
│3│T│n.│
│4│T│n.│
│2↓T↓n.↓
└→┴→┴─→┘
```

This is the same thing as a
[structure of arrays (SOA) representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#Structure_of_Arrays),
where each array of information (eg, the depth at `data[1]`, the `T`
information at `data[2]`) are each _arrays_ which can be accessed well on SIMD
instructions.

#### AST representation

TODO

#### Path matrices

We want information of how to go up and down the tree in ideally constant time.
We store this information in what is known as a _path matrix_.

For our recurring example, the path matrix is:

```
∘ a p b q v r c s w x t y z u | preorder traversal
──────────────────────────────────────────────────
∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ | depth=0
- a a b b b b c c c c c c c c | depth=1
- - p - q q r - s s s t t t u | depth=2
- - - - - v - - - w x - y z - | depth=3

      ∘             0
┌──┬──┴────┐
a  b       c        1
│ ┌┴┐  ┌───┼───┐
p q r  s   t   u    2
  │    │   |
  │   ┌┴┐ ┌┴┐
  v   w x y z       3
```

To efficiently compute this, we first replace every value in
our tree with its preorder traversal visit time. This changes
the tree to:

```
              ∘:0                               0
┌──────────┬──┴─────────────────┐

p:2    q:4     r:6   s:8        t:11    u:14    2

The values we store in the tree are the integers. The old labels
are represented for clarity.

The path matrix for this tree is:

#### Rendering the depth information in 2D

We use the incantation:

```
$ d ← (0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2)
$ ((⍳≢d)@(d,¨⍳≢d)) ((⌈/d) (≢d))⍴'-'
0 - - - - - - - - -  -  -  -  -  -
- 1 - 3 - - - 7 - -  -  -  -  -  -
- - 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 -  - 11  -  - 14
- - - - - 5 - - - 9  -  - 12  -  -
- - - - - - - - - - 10  -  - 13  -
```

Let's break this down (the symbol ` ` means a lamp, for commenting/illumination)


```
$ ⍳ 3 ⍝ iota: make a list of n elements:.
1 2 3
```

```
$ d
0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 4 2 3 4 2

$ ≢d ⍝ tally: ≢`. count no. of elements in d:
15
```

```
⍳≢d  ⍝ list of elements of len (no. of elements in d).
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

```
$ ]disp (1 2 3),(4 5 6) ⍝ ,:concatenate
┌→────┬─────┐
│1 2 3│4 5 6│
└~───→┴~───→┘
```

```
]disp (1 2 3) ,¨ (4 5 6)
┌→──┬───┬───┐
│1 4│2 5│3 6│
└~─→┴~─→┴~─→┘
```

The use of `¨` needs some explanation. `¨` is a higher order function which
takes a function and makes it a mapped version of the original function.
So, `,¨` is a function which attemps to map the concatenation operator.
Now, given two arrays `(1 2 3)`
and `(4 5 6)`, `(1 2 3) ,¨ 4 5 6` attemps to run `,` on each pair
`1 and 4`, `2 and 5`, `3 and 6`. This gives us tuples `((1 4) (2 5) (3 6))`.
So, for our purposes, `zip ← ,¨`.

```
]disp (d,¨⍳≢d) ⍝ zip d with [1..len d].
┌→──┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
│0 0│1 1│2 2│1 3│2 4│3 5│2 6│1 7│2 8│3 9│4 10│2 11│3 12│4 13│2 14│
└~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┘
```

```
$ ((⌈/d) (≢d))⍴'-' ⍝ array of dim (max val in d) x (no. of elem in d)
---------------
---------------
---------------
---------------
```

- `⌈` is the maximum operator and `/` is the fold operator, so
  `⌈/d` finds the maximum in `d`. Recall that `(≢d)` find the no. of
   elements in `d`. `⍴` reshapes an array to the desired size. We pass it
   a `1x1` array containing only `-`, which gets reshaped into a
   `(⌈/d) x (≢d)` sizes array of `-` symbols.


TODO: explain @ and its use

#### Creating the path matrix

```
$ ⎕IO ← 0 ⍝ (inform APL that we wish to use 0-indexing.)
$ d ← (0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2)
$ PM ← ⌈\((⍳≢d)@(d,¨⍳≢d))(((⌈/d+1)(≢d))⍴0)

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0  0  0  0  0
0 1 1 3 3 3 3 7 7 7  7  7  7  7  7
0 0 2 2 4 4 6 6 8 8  8 11 11 11 14
0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 9 10 10 12 13 13

      0               0
┌──┬──┴───────┐
1  3          7       1
│ ┌┴┐  ┌──────┼───┐

  │    │      |
  │   ┌┴─┐   ┌┴──┐
  5   9  10  12  13   3
```

The incantation can be broken down into:


- `(((⌈/d+1)(≢d))⍴0)` is used to create a `max(d+1)x|d|` dimension array of zeros.
   Here, the rows define depths, and the columns correspond to tree nodes
   which for us are their preorder indexes.

```
$ grid←(⌈/d+1) (≢d) ⍴ 0
$ grid
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

- `((d ,¨ ⍳≢d))` creates an array of pairs `(depth, preindex)`. We will use
  this to fill index `(d, pi)` with the value `pi`.

```
$ writeixs ← (d,¨⍳≢d)
$ ]disp writeixs
┌→──┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
│0 0│1 1│2 2│1 3│2 4│3 5│2 6│1 7│2 8│3 9│3 10│2 11│3 12│3 13│2 14│
└~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┘
```

- `ixgrid ← ((⍳≢d)@writeixs) grid` rewrites at index `writeixs[i]` the value (`(i≢d)[i]`).

```
$ ixgrid ← ((⍳≢d)@writeixs) grid
$ ixgrid
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0  0  0  0  0
0 1 0 3 0 0 0 7 0 0  0  0  0  0  0
0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 0  0 11  0  0 14
0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 9 10  0 12 13  0
```

- Finally, `⌈` is the maximum operator, and `\` is the [prefix scan]() operator,
  so `⌈\ixgrid` creates a prefix scan of the above grid to give us our
  final path matrix:

```
$ PM ← ⌈\ixgrid
$ PM
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0  0  0  0  0
0 1 1 3 3 3 3 7 7 7  7  7  7  7  7
0 0 2 2 4 4 6 6 8 8  8 11 11 11 14
0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 9 10 10 12 13 13
```

#### Using the path matrix:  distance of a node from every other node.

Note that the maximum distance between two nodes is to climb
all the way to the top node, and then climb down:

```
dmax ← depth(a) + depth(b)
```

If we know the lowest common ancestor of two nodes,
then the distance of one node to another is:

```
dcorrect ← dist(a, lca(a, b)) + dist(b, lca(a, b))
```

So, we can compute the depth as:

```
dcorrect ← dist(a, lca(a, b)) + dist(lca(a, b), b)
 = dist(a, lca(a, b)) + depth(lca(a, b)) +
   dist(b, lca(a, b)) + depth(lca(a, b)) +
   -2 * depth(lca(a, b))
 = depth(a) +
   depth(b) +
   -2 * depth (lca(a, b))
```

[TODO: finish writing this]


#### Parent vector representation

A parent vector is a vector of length `n` where `Parent[i]` denotes an
index into `Parent`. Hence, the following condition will return 1
if V is a parent vector.

For example, for our given example, here is the parent vector:

```
d ← (0  1  2  1  2  3  2  1  2  3  3  2  3  3  2) │ depths
    (∘  a  p  b  q  v  r  c  s  w  x  t  y  z  u) │ values
p ← (∘  ∘  a  ∘  b  q  b  ∘  c  s  s  c  t  t  c) │ parents
    (0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14) | indexes
P ← (0  0  1  0  3  4  3  0  7  8  8  7 11 11  7) │ parent indices



              ∘:0                               0
┌──────────┬──┴─────────────────┐
a:1        b:3                 c:7              1
│      ┌───┴───┐     ┌──────────┼───────┐
p:2    q:4     r:6   s:8        t:11    u:14    2
       │             │          │
       │          ┌──┴──┐     ┌─┴───┐
       v:5        w:9   x:10  y:12  z:13        3
```


The condition a parent vector must satisfy is:

```
∧/V ∊(⍳≢V) ⍝ [All elements of V belong in the list [1..len(V)] ]
```

- `V ∊ (⍳≢V)` will be a list of whether each element in v belongs (`∊`) to the list
  `(⍳≢V) = [1..len(V)]`
- Recall that `/` is for reduction, and `∧/` is a boolean `AND` reduction.
  Hence, we compute whether each element of the vector `V` is in the range `[1..len(V)]`.
- We add the constraint that root notes that don't have a parent simply
  point to themselves. This allows us to free ourselves from requiring
  some kind of `nullptr` check.


The root node (parent of all elements) can be found using the fixpoint operator (`⍨`):

```
I←{(⊂⍵)⌷⍺} ⍝ index into the left hand side param using right hand side param
I⍣≡⍨p ⍝ compute the fixpoint of the I operator using ⍨ and apply it to p
```



#### Converting from depth vector to parent vector, Take 1

As usual, let's consider our example:

```
d ← (0  1  2  1  2  3  2  1  2  3  3  2  3  3  2) │ depths
    (∘  a  p  b  q  v  r  c  s  w  x  t  y  z  u) │ values
p ← (∘  ∘  a  ∘  b  q  b  ∘  c  s  s  c  t  t  c) │ parents
    (0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14) | indexes
P ← (0  0  1  0  3  4  3  0  7  8  8  7 11 11  7) │ parent indices



              ∘:0                               0
┌──────────┬──┴─────────────────┐
a:1        b:3                 c:7              1
│      ┌───┴───┐     ┌──────────┼───────┐
p:2    q:4     r:6   s:8        t:11    u:14    2
       │             │          │
       │          ┌──┴──┐     ┌─┴───┐
       v:5        w:9   x:10  y:12  z:13        3
```

Note that the depth vector already encodes parent-child information.
- The parent of node `i` is a node `j` such that `d[j] = d[i] - 1` and
  `j` is the closest index to the left of `i` such that this happens.

For example, to compute the parent of `t:11`, notice that it's at depth `2`.
So we should find all the nodes from `d[0..11]` which have depths equal to
`2`, and then pick the rightmost one. This translates to the expression:

```
$ d ← (0  1  2  1  2  3  2  1  2  3  3  2  3  3  2)
$ t ← 11   ⍝ target node
$ ixs ← ⍳t   ⍝ array indexes upto this node
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
$ d[ixs]   ⍝ depths of nodes to the left of the given node t
  0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3
$ d[ixs]  = d[t]-1  ⍝ boolean vector of nodes whose depth is that of t's parent
  0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
$ eqds ← ⍸ (d[ixs] = d[t]-1)  ⍝ array indexes of nodes whose depth is that of t's parent
  1 3 7
$ ⌽ eqds ⍝ reverse of array indexes to extract `7`
  7 3 1
$ ⊃ ⌽ eqds ⍝ first of the reverse of the array indexes to extract `7`
  7
$ (⌽⍸(d[⍳t] = d[t]-1))[0]  ⍝ APL style one-liner of the above
```

While this is intuitive, this does not scale: It does not permit us to find
the parent of all the nodes _at once_ --- ie, it is not parallelisable
over choices of `t`.

#### Converting from depth vector to parent vector, Take 2 (Or scan idiom)

Imagine we have a list of `0`s and `1`s, and we want to find the _index_ of
the rightmost `1` value. For example, given:

```
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
$ a ← (0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0  0  0  0)
```

we want the answer to be `f a = 8`. We saw an implementation in terms of
`f←{(⌽⍸⍵)[0]}` in Take 1.
(recall that `⍵` is the symbol for the right-hand-side argument of a function).

We're going to perform the same operation slightly differently. Let's consider
the series of transformations:

```
⍝      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
$ a ← (0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0  0  0  0) ⍝ original array

$ ⌽a  ⍝ reverse of a
  0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0

$ ∨\ ⌽a ⍝ prefix scan(\) using the OR(∨) operator. Turn all
        ⍝ entries after the first 1 into a 1
  0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

$ +/ (∨\ ⌽a)  ⍝ sum over the previous list, counting number of 1s
  9

$ ¯1 +  (+/ (∨\ ⌽a))  ⍝ subtract 1 from the previous number
  8
```

Why the hell does this work? Well, here's the proof:

- On running `⌽a`, we reverse the `a`. The last 1 of `a` at index $i$
  becomes the first $1$ of `⌽a` at index $i' \equiv n-i$.
- On running  `∨\ ⌽a`, numbers including and after the first 1
  become `1`. That is, all indexes $j \geq i'$ have 1 in them.
- On running `+/ (∨\ ⌽a)`, we sum up all 1s. This will give us $n-i'+1$ 1s.
  That is, $n-i'+1 = n-(n-i)+1 =i+1$.
- We subtract a $1$ to correctly find the $i$ from $i+1$.

This technique will work for __every row of a matrix__. This is paramount,
since we can now repeat this for the depth vector we were previously
interested in for each row, and thereby compute the parent index!


#### Converting from depth vector to parent vector, Take 3 (full matrix)

We want to extend the previous method we hit upon to compute the parents
of all nodes in parallel. To perform this, we need to run the moral
equivalent of the following:

```
$ ⎕IO ← 0 ⍝ 0 indexing
$ d ← (0  1  2  1  2  3  2  1  2  3  3  2  3  3  2) ⍝ depth vector
$ t ← 11 ⍝ node we are interested in
$ a←d[⍳t]=d[t]-1  ⍝ boolean vector of nodes whose depth is that of t's parent
  0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
$ ¯1 +  (+/ (∨\ ⌽a)) ⍝ index of last 0 of boolean vector
7
```

for _every single choice of t_. To perform this, we can build a 2D matrix
of `d[⍳t]=d[t]-1` where `t` ranges over `[0..len(d)-1]` (ie, it ranges
over all the nodes in the graph).

We begin by using:

```
$ ⎕IO ← 0 ⋄ d ← (0  1  2  1  2  3  2  1  2  3  3  2  3  3  2) ⍝ depths
$ ]display ltdepth ← d ∘.> d ⍝ find `d[i] > d[j]` for all i, j.

│1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0│
└~────────────────────────────┘
```

- Note that `gt[i][j] = 1` iff `d[j] < d[i]`. So, for a given row (`i = fixed`), the `1s`
  nodes that are at lower depth (ie, potential parents).

- If we mask this to only have those indeces where `j <= i`, then the
  last one in each row will be such that `d[last 1] = d[i] - 1`. Why? Because
  the node that is closest to us with a depth less than us _must_ be our parent,
  in the preorder traversal.

```
$ ⎕IO ← 0 ⋄ d ← (0  1  2  1  2  3  2  1  2  3  3  2  3  3  2) ⍝ depths
$ ]display left ←  (⍳3) ∘.> (⍳3) ⍝ find `i > j` for all i, j.
┌→────┐
↓0 0 0│
│1 0 0│
│1 1 0│
└~────┘
```

Combining the three techniques, we can arrive at:

```
$ ⎕IO ← 0 ⋄ d ← (0  1  2  1  2  3  2  1  2  3  3  2  3  3  2) ⍝ depths
$ ltdepth ← d ∘.> d ⍝ find `d[i] > d[j]` for all i, j.
$ preds ←  (⍳≢d) ∘.> (⍳≢d) ⍝ predecessors: find `i > j` for all i, j.
$ pred_higher ←  ltdepth ∧ left   ⍝ predecessors tht are higher in the tree
$  parents_take_3 ← ¯1 +  +/∨\⌽pred_higher  ⍝ previous idiom for finding last 1.
¯1 0 1 0 3 4 3 0 7 8 8 7 11 11 7
```

For comparison, the actual value is:

```
    (0   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14)  | indexes

We have an off-by-one error for the `0` node! That's easily fixed, we simply
perform a maximum with `0` to move `¯1 -> 0`:

```
$  parents_take_3 ← 0⌈  ¯1 +  +/∨\⌽pred_higher
0 0 1 0 3 4 3 0 7 8 8 7 11 11 7
```

So, that's our function:

```
parents_take_3 ← 0⌈  ¯1 +  +/∨\⌽ ((d∘.>d) ∧ (⍳≢d)∘.>(⍳≢d))
0 0 1 0 3 4 3 0 7 8 8 7 11 11 7
```

Note that the time complexity for this is dominated by having to calculate
the outer products, which even given infinite parallelism, take $O(n)$ time.
We will slowly chip away at this, to be far better.

#### Converting from depth vector to parent vector, Take 4 (log critial depth)
We will use the Key(`⌸`) operator which allows us to create key value pairs.

```
$ d ← 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2
$ ]disp (⍳≢d) ,¨ d ⍝ zip d with indexes
┌→──┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬───┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
│0 0│1 1│2 2│3 1│4 2│5 3│6 2│7 1│8 2│9 3│10 3│11 2│12 3│13 3│14 2│
└~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~─→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┴~──→┘
```

```
$ d ← 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2
$ ]display b ← {⍺ ⍵}⌸d  ⍝ each row i has tuple (i, js): d[js] = i
┌→──────────────────┐

```

In fact, it allows us to apply an arbitrary function to combine keys and values.
We will use a function that simply returns all the values for each key.

```
$ d ← 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2
$ ]display b ← {⍵}⌸d ⍝ each row i contains values j such that d[j] = i.
┌→──────────────┐

└~──────────────┘
```

Our first try doesn't quite work: it winds up trying to create a numeric matrix,
which means that we can't have different rows of different sizes. So, the
information that _only_ index `0` is such that `d[0] = 0` is lost. What we
can to is to wrap the keys to arrive at:

```
$ d ← 0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2
$ ]display b ← {⊂⍵}⌸d ⍝ d[b[i]] = i
┌→───────────────────────────────────────────┐

└∊───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
Consider the groups `b[2] = (2 4 6 8 11 14)` and `b[3] = (5 9 10 12 13)`. All of `3`'s parents
are present in `2`. Every element in `3` fits at some location in `2`. Here is what
the fit would look like:

```
b[2]  2 4 _ 6 8 _  _ 11 __ __ 14   (nodes of depth 2)
b[3]      5     9  10   12 13      (leaf nodes)
          4     8   8   11 11      (parents: predecessor of b[3] in b[2])

              ∘:0                               0
┌──────────┬──┴─────────────────┐

       v:5        w:9   x:10  y:12  z:13        3
```

We use the Interval Index(`⍸`) operator to solve the problem of finding the
parent / where we should sqeeze a node from `b[3]` into `b[2]`
(This is formally known as the
[predecessor problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predecessor_problem))

```
⍝ left[a[i]] is closest number < right[i]
⍝ left[a[i]] is the predecessor of right[i] in left[i].
$ a ← (1 10 100 1000) ⍸ (1 2000 300 50 2 )
0 3 2 1 0
```

Now, we can use the technology of predecessor to find parents
of depth 3 nodes among the depth 2 nodes:

```
$ depth2 ← 2 4 6 8 11 14
$ depth3 ← 5 9 10 12 13 ⍝ parents (from chart): 4 8 8 11 11
$ depth3parentixs ← depth2 ⍸ depth3
$ depth3parents  ← depth2[depth3parentixs]
4 8 8 11 11

       v:5        w:9   x:10  y:12  z:13        3
```

We need to know one-more APL-ism: the `2-scan`. When we write
a usual scan operation, we have:

```
$ ⍳5
1 2 3 4 5
```
```
$ +/⍳5 ⍝ reduce
15
```

```
$ 2+/⍳5 ⍝ apply + to _pairs_ (2 = pairs)
3 5 7 9 ⍝ (1+2) (2+3) (3+4) (4+5)
```

```
$ 3+/⍳5 ⍝  apply + to 3-tuples
6 9 12 ⍝ (1+2+3) (2+3+4) (3+4+5)
```

We begin by assuming the parent of `i` is `i` by using `p←⍳≢d`.

```
$ d ← (0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2)
$ d2nodes ← {⊂⍵}⌸d
┌→┬─────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐
│1│2 4 8│3 5 7 9 12 15│6 10 11 13 14│
└→┴~───→┴~───────────→┴~───────────→┘
$ p←⍳≢d
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```

Now comes the biggie:
```
$ findparent ← {parentixs ← ⍺⍸⍵ ⋄ p[⍵]←⍺[parentixs]}
```
- `⍺` is the list of parent nodes.
- `⍵` is the list of current child nodes.
- We first find the indexes of our parent nodes by using
  the `pix ← parent ⍸ child` idiom.
- Then, we find the actual parents by indexing into
  the parent list: `pix[parentixs]`.
- We write these into the parents of the child using:
  `p[children] ← parent[parent ⍸ child]`


This finally culminates in:
```
$ d←0 1 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 3 3 2
$ p←⍳≢d ⋄ d2nodes←{⊂⍵}⌸d ⋄ findp←{pix ← ⍺⍸⍵ ⋄ p[⍵]←⍺[pix]} ⋄ 2findp/d2nodes ⋄ p
0 0 1 0 3 4 3 0 7 8 8 7 11 11 7


    (0   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14)  | indexes
d ← (0   1  2  1  2  3  2  1  2  3  3  2  3  3  2)  │ depths
P ← (0   0  1  0  3  4  3  0  7  8  8  7 11 11  7)  │ parent indices
              ∘:0                               0
┌──────────┬──┴─────────────────┐
a:1        b:3                 c:7              1

p:2    q:4     r:6   s:8        t:11    u:14    2
       │             │          │
       │          ┌──┴──┐     ┌─┴───┐
       v:5        w:9   x:10  y:12  z:13        3
```

Which can be further golfed to:
```
$ p⊣2{p[⍵]←⍺[⍺⍸⍵]}⌿⊢∘⊂⌸d⊣p←⍳≢d
0 0 1 0 3 4 3 0 7 8 8 7 11 11 7
```

The total time complexity of this method assuming infinite parallelism is as follows:
```
$ p←⍳≢d ⋄ d2nodes←{⊂⍵}⌸d ⋄ findp←{pix ← ⍺⍸⍵ ⋄ p[⍵]←⍺[pix]} ⋄ 2findp/d2nodes ⋄ p
```
- `(p←⍳≢d)` can be filled in `O(1)` time.
- `(d2nodes←{⊂⍵}⌸d)` is searching for keys in a small integer domain, so this is `O(#nodes)` using
  radix sort as far as I know. However, the thesis mentions that this can be done in
  `O(log(|#nodes|))`. I'm not sure how, I need to learn this.
- For each call of `findp`, the call `(pix ← ⍺⍸⍵)` can be implemented using binary search
  leading to a logarthmic complexity in the size of `⍺` (since we are looking up
  for predecessors of `⍵` in `⍺`).
- The time complexity of the fold `2findp/d2nodes` can be done entirely in parallel
  since all the writes into the `p` vector are independent: we only write the
  parent of the current node we are looking at.


### 3.4: Computing nearest Parent by predicate

I'm going to simplify the original presentation by quite a bit.


```
     a b c d e f g h i  | names
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  | indexes
P ← (0 0 1 2 0 4 5 6 7) | parents
X ← (0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0) | marked nodes

     a:0
┌────┴───┐
b:1(X)   e:4(X)
|        |
c:2      f:5(X)
|        |
d:3      g:6
         │
         h:7
         |
         i:8
```

We want to find nodes marked as `X` that are the closest parents to a
given node. The `X` vector is a boolean vector that has a `1` at
the index of each `X` node: `(b, e, f)`. So, the indexes `(1, 4, 5)`
are `1` in the `X` vector.

The output we want is the vector:

```
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  | indexes
      a b c d e f g h i  | names
PX ← (0 0 1 1 0 4 5 5 5) | closest X parent index
      a a b b a e f f f  | closest X parent name

    a:0
┌────┴───┐
b:1(X)   e:4(X)
|        |
c:2      f:5(X)
|        |
d:3      g:6
         │
         h:7
         |
         i:8
```

The incantation is:

```
$ I←{(⊂⍵)⌷⍺} ⍝ index LHS by RHS | (100 101 102 103)[(3 1 2)] := 103 101 102
$ PX ← P I@{X[⍵]≠1} ⍣ ≡ P
0 0 1 1 0 4 5 5 5
```

TODO. At any rate, since this does not require any writes and purely reads,
and nor does it need any synchronization, this is fairly straightforward
to implement on the GPU.

### 3.5: Lifting subtrees to the root

Once we have marked our `X` nodes, we now wish to lift entire subtrees of `X`
up to the root.
-  This pass displays how to lift subtrees and add new nodes to replace the subtree's original nodes.
- Luckily, there are no _sibling_ relationships that need to be maintained since
  we are uprooting an entire subtree.
- There are no _ordering constraints_ on how the subtrees should be arranged at
  the top.
- Hence, we can simply add new nodes to the _end_ of the tree (in terms of the preorder traversal).
  Adding to the middle of the tree will be discussed later.

There is some good advice in the thesis:
> When using APL primitives this way, it may be good to map
> their names and definitions to the domain of trees. For example,
> the primitive `⍸Predicate` is read as "the nodes where `Predicate` holds"
> and not as "the indexes where `Predicate` is 1".

For example, given the tree:

```
      0 1 2 3 4 5  | indexes
      a b c d e f  | names
P  ← (0 0 1 0 3 4) | parents
X  ← (0 1 0 1 1 0) | X nodes
PX ← (0 0 1 0 3 4) | closest X parent index

    a:0
┌────┴───┐
b:1(X)   d:3(X)
|        |
c:2      e:4(X)
         |
         f:5
```

we want the transformed tree to be:

```
    a:0
┌────┴───┐
bp:1(X)   ep:4(X)
---------
b:1(X)
|
c:2
---------
e:4
|
fp:5
---------
f:5(X)
|
g:6
```

We first look for nodes that need to be lifted.  There are:
- Non-root nodes (ie, nodes whose parents are not themselves: `p≠(⍳≢p)`)
- Which have the property `X`.

```
nodes←⍸(X ∧ p≠(⍳≢p))  ⍝ ⍸:pick indexes.
```

## [Things I wish I knew when I was learning APL](#things-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-was-learning-apl)

- For pasting multi-line code,
  [there is a bug in the bug tracker for RIDE](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride/issues/323).
  For multi-line dfns, one can use `∇`. For multi-line values, I don't know yet.

- Operators in APL terminology (such as `¨`) are higher order functions.
  Thus, an operator allows one to modify known functions.

- Use `]disp` and `]display` to understand the structure of APL arrays.

- Set `]box on -style=max` to _always enable_ drawing arrays with `]display`.
  This is supremely useful as a newbie to understand array structure.

- Set `]box on -trains=parens` to render trains as trees. Super
  helpful when attempting to grok `train` code.

- Set `]boxing on` to enable boxing for trains, arguments, everything.

## [Every ideal that is maximal wrt. being disjoint from a multiplicative subset is prime](#every-ideal-that-is-maximal-wrt-being-disjoint-from-a-multiplicative-subset-is-prime)

I ran across this when reading another question on math.se, so I
[posted this proof for verification](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3570129/proof-verification-request-complement-of-multiplicative-set-is-ideal-iff-the-id) just to be sure I wasn't missing
something.

We wish to characterise prime ideals as precisely those that are disjoint from
a multiplicative subset $S \subseteq R$. That is:

- An ideal $P$ is prime iff $P = R \setminus S$, where $S$ is a multiplicative subset
  that cannot be made larger (ie, is maximal wrt to the $\subseteq$ ordering).

I'll be using the definition of prime as:

- An ideal $P$ is prime if for all $x, y \in R$,
  $xy \in P \implies x \in P \lor y \in P$.


#### Prime ideal implies complement is maximal multiplicative subset:

Let $S = \equiv R \setminus P$ be the complement of the prime ideal $P \subsetneq R$
in question.
- Since $P \neq R$, $1 \not \in $P. (if $1 \in P$, then every element $x . 1 \in P$
  since $P$ is an ideal, and must be closed under multiplication with the
  entire ring). Hence, $1 \in S$.
- For any $x, y \in S$, we need $xy \in S$ for $S$ to be mulitplicative.
- For contradiction, let us say that $x, y \in S$ such that $xy \not \in S$.
  Translating to $P$, this means that $x, y \not \in P$ such that $xy \in P$.
  This contradictions the definition of $P$ being prime.

#### Ideal whose complement is maximal multiplicative subset implies ideal is prime.

- Let $I$ be an ideal of the ring $R$ such that its complement $S \equiv R / I$
  is a maximal multiplicative subset.
- Let $i_1 i_2 \in I$. For $I$ to be prime,
  we need to show that $i_1 \in I$ or $i_2 \in I$.
- For contradiction, let $i_1, i_2 \not \in I$.
  Thus, $i_1, i_2 \in S$. Since $S$ is multiplicative, $i_1 i_2 \in S$. That is,
  $i_1 i_2 \not \in I$ (since $I$ is disjoint from $S$).
- But this violates our assumption that $i_1 i_2 \in I$. Hence, contradiction.


## [Getting started with APL](#getting-started-with-apl)

- Install [Dyalog APL](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm).
- Setup [RIDE](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride), the IDE for dyalog APL.
  This IDE comes with auto complete, good key bindings, a top bar chock-full of
  information of all the APL symbols. It's really well designed and a pleasure
  to use.
- Follow the [Dyalog tutorial](https://tutorial.dyalog.com/), solving it
  chapter by chapter.
- Bookmark [APLCart](https://aplcart.info/), a collection of APL idioms, and
  refer to it when in need.

## [SpaceChem was the best compiler I ever used](#spacechem-was-the-best-compiler-i-ever-used)

It's kind of sad that this is the case, but on thinking about this, I realised
that the SpaceChem game was essentially a compiler, and it was such a pleasure
to learn how to use and debug --- the visual nature of it made it amazing to
find out.

## [Mnemonic for Kruskal and Prim](#mnemonic-for-kruskal-and-prim)

I often forget which is which, so I came up with this:

- Prim is very prim and proper, and therefore doesn't spread herself out. She
  picks out the minimum spanning tree one vertex at a time.


## [Legendre transform](#legendre-transform)

<img  src="./static/legendre.png">


## [Cartesian Trees](#cartesian-trees)

Cartesian trees construct a tree $T = C(A)$ given an array $A$, such that
range minimum query (RMQ) on the array $A$ is equivalent to the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
of the nodes of the tree $T$.


<img width=200 height=200 src="./static/cartesian-tree.svg">

Note that the tree looks like a _min-heap_.

To see the connection to LCA, if we want to find the range minimum in the range containing the
elements `[12, 10, 20, 15, 18]` of the array, the minimum is `10`, which is
indeed the lowest common ancestor of the nodes of `12` and `18` in the tree.

#### Building a Cartesian tree in linear time:

#### Converting LCA to RMQ

We can go the other way, and convert an LCA problem into a RMQ problem. We
perform an inorder traversal of the nodes, scribbling down the
depth of the node ([Link to lecture at 15:30](https://youtu.be/0rCFkuQS968?t=934)).
We ask for the _argmin_ version of RMQ, that gives us the _index_ of
the node with the lowest depth. This gives us the index of where the node lives.

#### Universe reduction in RMQ

We can have an arbitrary ordered universe, on which we want to perform RMQ.
We can convert this to LCA by using a cartesian tree, and then convert to
a "clean" RMQ (by using the LCA -> RMQ using depth conversion). This now
will give us way faster operations (since we now have integers).

#### `+-1` RMQ:

We want the differences between nodes to have a difference of only `+-1`. We
had a much wider gap. Here, we perform an Euler tour (walk the tree DFS search order),
and sribble down every vertex we visit.

To find the LCA, we perform the RMQ on the locations of the _first_ occurence
of the node. (I think we don't actually need the first occurence, any
occurence will do).

## [DFS numbers as a monotone map](#dfs-numbers-as-a-monotone-map)

Really, we want a partial order that is defined with the tree as the
Hasse diagram. However, performing operations on this is hard. Hence,
the DFS numbering is a good monotone map from this partial order
to the naturals, which creates a total order.

I want to think about this deeper, I feel that this might be a good way
to think about the `low` numbers that show up in
[tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm)

This also begs the question: can we use other partial orders, that chunk
some information, but don't lose _all_ the information as going to a total
order (the naturals) does?

## [Self attention? not really](#self-attention-not-really)

The code is taken from [The annotated transformer](https://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html)
which explains the "attention is all you need paper".

On skimming the code, one sees the delightful line of code:

```py
class EncoderLayer(nn.Module):
  "Encoder is made up of self-attn and feed forward (defined below)"
  def __init__(self, size, self_attn, feed_forward, dropout):
     super(EncoderLayer, self).__init__()
     self.self_attn = self_attn
     self.feed_forward = feed_forward
     self.sublayer = clones(SublayerConnection(size, dropout), 2)
     self.size = size
  def forward(self, x, mask):
    "Follow Figure 1 (left) for connections."
    x = self.sublayer[0](x, lambda x: self.self_attn(x, x, x, mask))
    return self.sublayer[1](x, self.feed_forward)
```

where the line:

```py
x = self.sublayer[0](x, lambda x: self.self_attn(x, x, x, mask))
```

seems to imply that we are, indeed, performing a self attention with the same
value `x` as the query, key, and value.

However, reading the code of the self-attention (or the paper) leads
one to realise:

```py
class MultiHeadedAttention(nn.Module):

where we notice:

```py
## 1) Do all the linear projections in batch from d_model => h x d_k
query, key, value = \
  [l(x).view(nbatches, -1, self.h, self.d_k).transpose(1, 2)

## 2) Apply attention on all the projected vectors in batch.
x, self.attn = attention(query, key, value, mask=mask,
                         dropout=self.dropout)
```

where we see that `query, key, value` are being linearly transformed
before being used. Hence, an input of $(x, x, x)$ is transformed
to $(q', k', v') = (Qx, Kx, Vx)$ where $Q, K, V$ are arbitrary matrices.

Next, when we pass these into attention, the output we get is:

$$
\text{softmax}(q', k'^T) v = (Q x) (K x)^T (V x) = Q x x^T K^T V x
$$

the code below is the same thing, spelled out:


```
def attention(query, key, value, mask=None, dropout=None):
    "Compute 'Scaled Dot Product Attention'"
    d_k = query.size(-1)
    scores = torch.matmul(query, key.transpose(-2, -1)) \
             / math.sqrt(d_k)
    if mask is not None:
        scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, -1e9)
    p_attn = F.softmax(scores, dim = -1)
    if dropout is not None:
        p_attn = dropout(p_attn)
    return torch.matmul(p_attn, value), p_attn
```

So It's not _really_ self attention: it's more like: modulated attention
to self `:)`


## [Coarse structures](#coarse-structures)

A coarse structure on the set $X$ is a collection of relations on $X$:
$E \subseteq 2^{X \times X}$ (called as _controlled sets_ / _entourages_)
such that:

- $(\delta \equiv \{ (x, x) : x \in X \}) \in  E$.
- Closed under subsets: $\forall e \in E, f \subset e \implies f \in E$.
- Closed under transpose: if $e \in E$ then $(e^T \equiv \{ (y, x) : (x, y) \in e \}) \in E$.
- Closed under finite unions.
- Closed under composition: $\forall e, f \in E, e \circ f \in E$, where $\circ$
  is composition of relations.

The sets that are controlled are "small" sets.

The bounded coarse structure on a metric space $(X, d)$ is the set of all relations
such that there exists a uniform bound such that all related elements are within
that bounded distance.
$$
(e \subset X \times X) \in E \iff \exists \delta \in \mathbb R, \forall (x, y) \in E, d(x, y) < \delta
$$


We can check that the functions:
- $f: \mathbb Z \rightarrow \mathbb R, f(x) \equiv x$ and
- $g: \mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb Z, g(x) \equiv \lfloor x \rfloor$

are coarse inverses to each other.

I am interested in this because if topology is related to semidecidability,
then coarse structures (which are their dual) are related to..?

## [Matroids for greedy algorithms](#matroids-for-greedy-algorithms)

#### Definitions of matroids

A matrioid $M$ is a set $X$ equipped with an independence set $I \subseteq 2^X$.
- The empty set is independent: $\emptyset \in I$.
- The independence set is downward-closed/closed under subsets:  $ \forall i \in I, \forall i' \subseteq i, i' \in I$.
- For any independent sets $A, B \in I$, if $\vert A \vert$ is larger than
  $\vert B \vert$, then we must be able to add an element from
  $a \in A$ into $B' \equiv B \cup {a}$ such that $B'$ is both independent and larger than $B$:
  $B' \in I \land \vert B' \vert > \vert B \vert$. (**The exchange property**)

#### Example 1: Linearly independent sets
Let $V$ be a vector space. The independent sets $I$ are of the form:


$$ I \equiv \{ S \subseteq V ~:~ \text{vectors in $S$ are lineary independent} \} $$

This is an independence system because the empty set is linearly independent,
and subsets of a linearly independent collection of vectors will be linearly
independent.

The exchange property is satisfied because of linear algebraic reasons.

#### Example 2: The graphic/cyclic Matroid: Matroid of Forests

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. Then collections of edges of the form:

$$ I \equiv \{ F \subseteq E : \text{$F$ contains no cycles} \} $$

is an independence system because the empty forest is a forest, and
a subset of edges of a forest continues to be a forest.

To check the exchange property, TODO

#### Example 3: The partition matroid

Consider the partition matroid $M \equiv (E, I)$, where we have a
partitioning of $E$ known as $E_i$, and numbers $k_i$ the
independence set consists of subsets $F$ which have at most $k_i$
elements in common with each $E_i$.
$$
I \equiv \{ F \subseteq E  : \forall i = 1, \dots N, \vert F \cap E_i \vert \leq k_i \}
$$

The independence axioms are intuitively satisfied, since our constraints on picking
edges are of the form $\vert F \cap E_i \vert \leq k_i$, which will continue to
hold as $F$ becomes smaller.

For the exchange axiom, let $\vert Y \vert > \vert X \vert$. Then, we can assert that for some index
$i$, it must be the case that $\vert Y \cap E_i \vert > \vert X \cap E_i \vert$. Hence,
we can add an element in $E_i \cap (Y / X)$ into $X$ whilst still maintaining independence.


#### Bases and Circuits

- **Bases** are the maximal independent sets of $I$ (ordered by inclusion). On adding an element into a basis element, they
  will become dependent. They are called bases by analogy with linear algebra.

- **Circuits** are minimal dependent sets of $I$. This comes from analogy with trees: if we remove an element
  from any circuit (loop) in a graph, what we are left with is a tree.

A matroid can be completely categorized by knowing either the bases or the circuits of that matroid.

#### Unique Circuit property
- **Theorem**: Let $M \equiv (E, I)$ be a matroid, and let $S \in I, e \in E$ such that $S \cup \{e \} \not \in I$.

Then, there exists a **unique circuit** $C \subseteq S \cup \{ e \}$.

That is, when we go from independent to dependent by adding an element, we will
have a **single, unique circuit**. For example, when we add an edge into a
forest to create a cycle, this cycle will be unique!

##### Proof

Let $C_1, C_2$ be circuits
created when $e$ was added into $S$, where $C_1$ is the **largest** circuit of $S$,
and $C_2$ is the **smallest** circuit of $S$.

Notice that $C_1, C_2$ __must__ contain $e$ ---
if they did not, then $C_1, C_2$ would be circuits in
$S$, contradicting the assumption that $S$ is independent.

Recall that $C_1, C_2$ are both circuits, which means that removing even a
single element from them will cause them to become independent sets.

Let us contemplate $C \equiv C_1 \cup C_2$. Either $C = C_1$ in which
case we are done.

Otherwise, $\vert C \vert > \vert C_1 \vert$, $\vert C \vert > \vert C_2 \vert$.

Otherwise, consider $C' \equiv C \ \{ e \} = (C_1 \cup C_2) \ \{e\} = (C_1 \ \{e\}) \cup (C_2 \ \{ e \})$.
- $C' \subseteq S$, since $\C_1 \ \{e\}, C_2 \ \{e\} \subseteq S$.
- $S$ is an independent set, all of whose subsets are independent by
  definition.  So $C'$ is an independent set.
- $\vert C' \vert \geq \vert C_1 \vert$, $\vert C' \vert \geq \vert C_2 \vert$.

Now, we consider $C$. Clearly, this is a dependent set,
since $C_1 \subsetneq C$, and $C_1$ is a dependent set.

Since, $C = C' \cup \{e \}$, this means that $C'$ is a maximally independent set.
Since $C'$ does not contain $e$, $C' = S$.


#### Rank functions

A rank function of a matroid $M \equiv \langle X, I \rangle$
is a function:

$$
r: 2^X \rightarrow \mathbb N : r(S) = \max \{ \vert T \vert : T \subseteq S \land T \in I \}
$$

That is, for any subset $S \subseteq X$, $r(S)$ is the cardinality of the
largest independent subset of $S$.

- In the matroid of linearly independent sets of vectors, the rank of
  a set of vectors is the dimension of their spanning set.


In this matroid, the

#### Bipartite matching as matroid intersection

Matchings in a bipartite graph $G = (V, E)$ with partition $(A, B)$ arise
as the intersection of the independent sets of two matroids.
We will denote by $\delta: V \rightarrow 2^E$ the function which takes
a vertex to the set of edges incident on that vertex.

Let $M_A$ be a _partition matroid_: $M_A \equiv (E, I_A)$ where $I_A$ is:
$$
I_A \equiv \{ F \subseteq E : \vert F \cap \delta(a) \vert \leq 1 \forall a \in A \}
$$
That is, in $I_A$, every independent set has for each vertex of $A$, at most
one edge incident. We need to check that this is an independent set.
The empty set of no edges is independent. If some collection of edges are
such that they have at most one edge incident, then removing edges can
only _decrease_ incidence. Hence, it's also downward closed.


TODO: add picture

Similarly, we define $M_B \equiv (E, I_B)$:
$$
I_B \equiv \{ F \subseteq E : \vert F \cap \delta(b) \vert \leq 1 \forall b \in B \}
$$

Now, notice that any collection of edges $F \in I_A \cap I_B$ is a legal
matching, since the edges cover all vertices of $A$ and $B$ at most once.
The largest element of $I_A \cap I_B$ is the _maximum matching_ that we
are looking for.

#### Largest common independent set

Given two matroids $M_1 \equiv (E, I_1)$, $M_2 \equiv (E, I_2)$, with rank
functions $r_1$ and $r_2$. Let $S \in I_1 cap I_2$ and let $F \subseteq E$.
-  $\vert S \vert = \vert S \cap F \vert + \vert S \cap (E / F) \vert$.

## [Grokking Zariski](#grokking-zariski)

There's a lot written on the Zariski topology on the internet, but most
of them lack explicit examples and pictures. This is my attempt to
communicate what the Zariski topology looks like, from the perspectives
that tickle my fancy (a wealth of concrete examples,
topology-as-semi-decidability, and pictures).

#### The Zariski topology

Recall that the Zariski topology is defined by talking about what its
closed sets are. The common zero sets of a family of polynomials are
the closed sets of the Zariski topology. Formally, the topology $(\mathbb R^n, \tau)$
has as closed sets:

$$
\{ x \in \mathbb R^n : \forall f_i \in \mathbb R[X_1, X_2, \dots X_n],  f_i(x) = 0  \}
$$

Open sets (the complement of closed sets) are of them form:

$$
\{ x \in \mathbb R^n : \exists f_i \in \mathbb R[X_1, X_2, \dots X_n],  f_i(x) \neq 0  \} \in \tau
$$

The empty set is generated as $\{ x \in \mathbb R^n : 0 \neq 0 \}$ and the
full set is generated as $\{ x \in \mathbb R^n : 1 \neq 0 \}$.


#### Semi-decidability

Recall that in this view of topology, for a space $(X, \tau)$, for every
open set $O \in \tau$, we associate a turing machine $T_O$ which semi-decides
inclusion. That is, if a point is in $O$ then it halts with the output `IN-SET`.
if the point is not in $O$, $T_O$ infinite loops. Formally:

$$
\begin{align*}
x &&\in O \iff \text{$T_O$ halts on input $x$} \\
x &&\not \in O \iff \text{$T_O$ does not halts on input $o$}
\end{align*}
$$

Alternatively, for a closed set $C \in \tau$, we associate a a turing machine
$T_C$ which semi-decides exclusion. That is, if a point is _not_ in $C$
it halts with the output "NOT-IN-SET". If the point is in $C$, the turing
machine $T_C$ infinite loops.

Now in the case of polynomials, we can write a function that semidecides
exclusion from closed sets:

```cpp
# return NOT-IN-SET of x is not a zero of the polynomial
def is_not_in_zeros(poly, x0):
  precision = 0 # start with zero precision
  while True:
    if poly(x0[:precision]) != 0: return NOT-IN-SET
    precision += 1 # up the precision
```

Since we can only evaluate a polynomial up to some finite precision, we
start with zero precsion and then gradually get more precise. If some
$x0$ is _not_ a root of $poly$, then at some point, we will have
that $poly(x0) /neq 0$. If $x0$ is indeed a root, then we will never halt
this process; We will keep getting `poly(x0[:precision]) = 0` for all
levels of precision.

#### `Spec(R)`

- To setup a topology for the prime spectrum of a ring, we define the topological
  space as $Spec(R)$, the set of all prime ideals of $R$.

- The closed sets of the topology are $\{ V(I) : I \text{is an ideal of $R$} \}$,
  where the function $V: \text{Ideal} \rightarrow 2^\text{Prime Ideal}$ maps
  each ideal to the set of prime ideals that contain it. Formally,
  $V(I) = \{ p \in Spec(R) : I \subseteq p \}$. 


- We can think of this differently, by seeing that we can rewrite the condition
  as  $V(I) = \{ P \in Spec(R) : I \xrightarrow{P} 0}$: On rewriting using the prime ideal $P$, we send the ideal $I$ to $0$.

- Thus, the closed sets of $Spec(R)$ are precisely the 'zeroes of polynomials' / 'zeroes of ideals'.

- To make the analogy precise, note that in the polynomial case, we imposed a 
  topology on $\mathb R$ by saying that the closed sets were $V(p_i) = \{ x \in \mathbb R : p(x) = 0 \}$
  for some polynomial $p \in \mathbb R[x]$. 
  
- Here, we are saying that the closed sets are $V(I) = \{ x \in Spec(R) : I(x) = 0 \}$
  for some ideal $I \in R$. so we are looking at  ideals as functions
  from the prime ideal to the reduction of the ideal. That is, $I(P) = I/P$. 

#### `Spec(\mathbb Z)` from this perspective

Since $\mathbb Z$ is a PID, we can think of numbers instead of ideals. The above
picture asks us to think of a number as a function from a prime to a reduced
number. $n(p) = n \% p$. We then have that the closed sets are those primes
which can zero out some number. That is:

$$
\begin{align*}
V(I) = \{ x \in Spec(\mathbb Z) : I(x) = 0 \}
V((n)) = \{ (p) \in Spec(\mathbb Z) : (n)/(p) = 0 \}
V((n)) = \{ (p) \in Spec(\mathbb Z) : (n) \mod (p) = 0 \}
\end{align*}
$$

So in our minds eye, we need to imagine a space of prime ideals (points), which
are testing with all ideals (polynomials). Given a set of prime ideals (a tentative locus, say a circle),
the set of prime ideals is closed if it occurs as the zero of some collection of ideas 
(if the locus occurs as the zero of some collection of polynomials). 


## [My preferred version of quicksort](#my-preferred-version-of-quicksort)

Wikipedia lists the implementation of quicksort as:

```cpp
algorithm quicksort(A, lo, hi) is
    if lo < hi then
        p := partition(A, lo, hi)
        quicksort(A, lo, p - 1)
        quicksort(A, p + 1, hi)

algorithm partition(A, lo, hi) is
    pivot := A[hi]
    i := lo
    for j := lo to hi do
        if A[j] < pivot then
            swap A[i] with A[j]
            i := i + 1
    swap A[i] with A[hi]
    return i
```

Here, the indeces `[lo..i-1]` have values less than the pivot, while
`[i..j]` are great or equal to the pivot.

##### The version I prefer

```cpp
// #define SWAP(ix, ix2) { int t = a[ix]; a[ix] = a[ix2]; a[ix2] = t; }
// sorts the interval [l, r]
void qs(int l, int r) {
    if (r - l < 0) return;
    int part = a[r]; // the partition

    // a[getill...n] >= part (getill = greater or equal till)
    // starts at r since we know that a[r] >= (partition=a[r])
    int getill = r;
    // a[l..lttill] < part (lttill = less or equal till.
    // starts at (l-1) since we do not know about any value < partition
    int lttill = l-1;


    // loop until they start probing into the other set
    while(!(lttill+1 >=getill || getill-1 <=lttill)) {
        // if the speculated element is < partition
        if (a[getill-1] < part) {
            // swap the value at getill-1 will the slot at lttill+1
            SWAP(getill-1, lttill+1);
            // increment lttill, since we KNOW that the
            // value at lttill+1 = a[getill-1] is < part
            lttill++;
        } else {
            // all we know is that a[getill-1] < part, so we can engulf
            // the region into
            getill--;
        }
    }
    // the partitions must be next to each other, since we have engulfed everything
    assert(getill - lttill == 1);
    // move the partition value to the center.
    SWAP(getill, r);

    // recurse:solve [l..littil] (leave getill=part alone) solve [getill+1..r]
    qs(l, lttill);
    qs(getill+1, r);
}
```

This implementation to me makes very clear to me what information is "known":
- The segments that is strictly less than the partition.
- The segment that is strictly great or equal the partition.

It also makes clear what is being "probed"/"tentative":
- anything we are accessing as `+-1` is not known yet, we are feeling out
  the boundaries of our partitions.

The termination condition is clear: when one partition starts reaching into
the other partitions resources, its done.

Due to using closed intervals everywhere, it's very easy to see precisely
what data starts and ends where.

What version of quicksort do you prefer? Drop me an email!

## [Geometric proof of Cauchy Schwarz inequality](#geometric-proof-of-cauchy-schwarz-inequality)

<img src="./static/cauchy-schwarz.svg">

- All credit goes to `p0a` on `##math` on freenode for teaching me this proof!

Here's one fun application of Cauchy-Schwarz. We can apply it to two vectors
$x=(\sqrt a, \sqrt b)$ and $y=(\sqrt b, \sqrt a)$ to derive the AM-GM
inequality:




## [Dataflow analysis using Grobner basis](#dataflow-analysis-using-grobner-basis)

This was a quick experiment in using Grobner basis to model situations. We
can represent our dataflow analysis constraints in terms of polynomial
rewrites over $F_2$.

Given the program:

```py
p = { 0: ["=", "x", 'y'],
      1: ['br', 2, 100],
      2: ['=', 'z', 'x'],
      3: ['br', 2],
      100: ['ret', 'z'] }
```

whose semantics I hope are fairly straightforward --- the dictionary represents
instruction locations. Instructions proceed sequentially. branch moves
control flow around. Note that `br` can branch to multiple locations,
since we are not control-flow sensitive.

The idea is that since in a dataflow analysis, we need information at
each variable at each program point, we can create a ring of polynomials
over $F_2$ for each variable at each program point. So in this case,
we wold need:

```
R = F_2[x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, x3, y3, z3, x100, y100, z100]
```

We then add elements into the ideal that represents our constraints.
For example, to perform dataflow analysis, we need to add constraints
about how if a variable `z` is alive, all variables that are used
to compute `z` at `100` are alive. This sets up equations that may
have cycles (in the case of loops).

These are usually resolved using the
[Kildall algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis#An_iterative_algorithm).

However, we can also ask SAGE to kindly solve the Grobner basis. I hypothesize
that the "easy" dataflow problems out to be [toric ideals](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00074446/document)
which admit much faster solutions.



## [Fenwick trees and orbits](#Fenwick-trees-and-orbits)

I learnt of a nice, formal way to prove the correctness of Fenwick
trees in terms of orbits that I wish to reproduce here.

One can use a Fenwick tree to perform cumulative sums
$Sum(n) \equiv \sum_i^n A[i]$, and updates $Upd(i, v) \equiv A[i] += v$. Naively,
cumulative sums can take $O(n)$ time and updates take $O(1)$ time.

A Fenwick tree can perform _both_ in $\log(n)$. In general, we can perform
any monoid-based catenation and update in $\log(n)$.

#### organization

We allow indexes $[1, 2, \dots n]$. The node with factorization $i \equiv 2^k \times l$,
$2 \not \vert l$ (that is, $k$ is the highest power of $2$ in $i$)
is responsible for the interval $[i-2^k+1, i] = (i-2^k, i]$.


I'm going to state all the manipulations in terms of prime factorizations,
since I find it far more intuitive than bit-fiddling. In general, I want
to find a new framework to discover and analyze bit-fiddling heavy algorithms.

Some examples of the range of responsibility of an index are:

- $1 = 2^0 \times 1 = (0, 1]$ (Subtract $2^0 = 1$)
- $2 = 2\times 1 = (0, 2]$ (Subtract $2^1 = 2$)
- $3 = 3 = (2, 3]$
- $4 = 2^2 = (0, 4]$
- $5 = 5 = (4, 5]$
- $6 = 2\times 3 = (4, 6]$
- $7 = 7 = (6,7]$
- $8 = 2^3 = (0,8]$
- $9 = 9 = (8, 9]$
- $10 = 2\times 5 = (8, 10]$
- $11 = 11 = (10, 11]$
- $12 = 2^2\times 3 = (8, 12]$
- $13 = 13 = (12, 13]$
- $14 = 2\times 7 = (12, 14]$
- $15 = 15 = (14, 15]$
- $16 = 2^4 = (0, 16]$

<img width=300 src="./static/fenwick-structure.gif">


#### query

To perform a cumulative sum, we need to read from the correct overlap regions
that cover the full array. For example, to read from $15$, we would want
to read:

- $a[15] = (14, 15], a[14] = (12, 14], a[12] = (8, 12], a[8] = (0, 8]$.

So we need to read the indices:
- $15=2^0 \cdot 15 \xrightarrow{-2^0} 14=2^1 \cdot 7 \xrightarrow{-2^1} 12=2^2\cdot3 \xrightarrow{-2^2} 8=2^3\cdot1 \xrightarrow{-2^3} 0$

At each  location, we strip off the value $2^r$. We can discover this value
with bit-fiddling: We claim that $a \& (-a) = 2^r$.

Let $a = x 1 0^r$. Now, $-a = \lnot a + 1 = x01^r + 1 = \overline{x}10^r$.
Hence, $a \& (-a) = a \& (\lnot a + 1) = (x 10^r) \& (\overline{\x}10^r) = 0^{|\alpha|}10^r = 2^r$

So the full implementation of query is:

```cpp
#define LSB(x) x&(-x)
int a[N];
int q(int i) {
    int s = 0;
    while (i > 0) { s += a[i]; i -= LSB(i); }
    return s;
}

```

#### update

To perform an update at $i$, we need to update all locations which on querying
overlap with $i$. For example, to update the location $9$, we would want to
update:

- $a[9] = (8, 9], a[10] = (8, 10], a[12] = (8, 12], a[16] = (0, 16]$.

So we need to update the indices:

- $9=2^0 \cdot 9 \xrightarrow{+2^0} 10=2^1 \cdot 5 \xrightarrow{+2^1} 12=2^2\cdot3 \xrightarrow{+2^2} 16=2^4\cdot1 \xrightarrow{+2^4} \dots$

We use the same bit-fiddling technique as above to strip off the value $2^r$


```cpp
#define LSB(x) x&(-x)
int tree[N];
int u(int i, int v) {
    while (i < N) { tree[i] += v; i += LSB(i); }
}
```


#### correctness

We wish to analyze the operations $Query(q) \equiv \sum_{i=1}^q a[i]$, and
$Update(i, val) \equiv a[i]~\texttt{+=}~val$. To do this, we are allowed to maintain
an auxiliary array $d$ which we will manipuate. We will stipulate the
conditions of operations on $d$ such that they will reflect the values of
$Query$ and $Update$, albeit much faster.

We will analyze the algorithm in terms of orbits. We have two operators, one
for update called $U$, and one for query called $Q$. Given an index $i$,
repeatedly applying the query operator gives us the indeces we need to read and
accumulate from the underlying array $a$ to get the total sum $a[0..i]$:

- $Query(i) = \sum_i d[Q^i(q)]$

Given an index $u$, repeatedly applying the update operator $U$ gives us all
the indeces we need to add the change to update:
- $Update(i, val) = \forall j~, d[U^j(i)]~\texttt{+=}~ val$

For query and update to work, we need the condition that:
- $q \geq u \iff \left\vert \{ Q^i(q)~:~ i \in \mathbb{N} \} \cap \{ U^i(u)~:~i \in \mathbb{N} \} \right\vert = 1$

That is, if and only if the query index $q$ includes the update location $u$,
will the orbits intersect.

The intuition is that we want updates at an index $u$ to only affect queries
that occur at indeces $q \geq u$. Hence, we axiomatise that for an update
to be legal, it must the orbits of queries that are at indeces greater than it.

We will show that our operators:
- $Q(i=2^r\cdot a) = i - 2^r = 2^r(a-1)$
- $U(j=2^s\cdot b) = j + 2^{s} = 2^{s}(b+1)$

do satisfy the conditions above.

For a quick numerical check, we can use the code blow to ensure
that the orbits are indeed disjoint:
```py
## calculate orbits of query and update in fenwick tree

def lsb(i): return i & (-i)
def U(i): return i + lsb(i)
def Q(i): return i - lsb(i)
def orbit(f, i):
    s = set()
    while i not in s and i > 0 and i < 64:
        s.add(i); i = f(i)
    return s

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for q in range(1, 16):
        for u in range(1, 16):
            qo = orbit(Q, q); uo = orbit(U, u)
            c = qo.intersection(uo)
            print("q:%4s | u:%4s | qo: %20s | uo: %20s | qu: %4s" %
                  (q, u, qo, uo, c))

        print("--")
```

##### Case 1: $q = u$

We note that $Q$ always decreases the value of $q$, and $u$ always increases
it. Hence, if $q = u$, they meet at this point, and
$\forall i, j \geq 1, \quad Q^i (q) \neq U^j(u)$.
Hence, they meet exactly once as required.

##### Case 2: $q < u$

As noted above, $q$ always decreases and $u$ always increases, hence in this
case they will never meet as required.


##### Case 3: $q > u$

Let the entire array have size $2^N$.
Let $q = \texttt{e1 f_q}, u = \texttt{e0 f_u}$, where
$\texttt{e, f_q, f_u}$ may be empty strings.

Notice that $Q$ will always strip away rightmost ones in $f_q$,
leading to $q = \texttt{e10...0}$ at some point.

Similarly, $U$ will keep on adding new rightmost ones, causing the
state to be $u = \texttt{e01...10...0} \xrightarrow{U} \texttt{e100...}$.

Hence, at some point $q = u$.

## [Dirichlet inversion](#Dirichlet-inversion)

We call all functions $f: \mathbb Z \rightarrow \mathbb R$ as
_arithmetic functions_, since they operate on the integers.

We introduce an operator $f \star g: \mathbb Z \rightarrow \mathbb R$.
It is defined by:
- $(f \star g)(n) \equiv \sum_{d \vert n} f(d) g(n/d)$

We will show that the set of arithmetic functions forms a group
under the operator $\star$, with identity:

-  $id_\star(n) \equiv \floor{1/n} = \begin{cases} 1 & n = 1 \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$


The reason all of this is interesting is that the inverse of the constant function $1(n) \equiv 1$
is going to be this function called as the mobius function $\mu$:

$$
\mu(n=p_1^\alpha_1 p_2^\alpha_2 \dots p_r^\alpha_r) \equiv
\begin{cases}
  0 & \text{if any $\alpha_i > 1$} \\
  (-1)^{\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \dots + \alpha_r} & \text{if all $\alpha_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}$}
\end{cases}
$$

The mobius function will allow us to perform _mobius inversion_:

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(n) &\equiv \sum_{d \vert n} g(d) = \sum_{d \vert n} g(d) 1(n/d) = g \star 1 \\
  f \star 1^{-1} &=  g \star 1 \star 1^{-1} \\
  f \star \mu &= g
\end{align*}
$$

That is, we originally had $f$ defined in terms of $g$. We can
recover an expression for $g$ in terms of $f$.

### The algebra of multiplicative functions

We claim that the set of functions $\{ \mathbb Z \rightarrow \mathbb C \}$
is a commutative group, with the group operation $\star$ such that:

- $(f \star g)(n) \equiv \sum_{d \vert n} f(d) g(n/d)$.

with the identity element being $id_\star(n) \equiv \lfloor 1 / n \rfloor$. The idea
is that if $(n = 1)$, then $\lfloor 1/1 \rfloor = 1$, and for any other
number $n > 0$, $1/n < 1$, hence $\lfloor 1/n \rfloor = 0$.

### verification of $istar$ being the identity
$$
\begin{align*}
(f \star id_\star)(n) \equiv \sum_{d \vert n} f(d) id_\star(n/d) \\
&= f(n) id_\star(1) + \sum_{d \vert n, d > 1} f(n) id_\star(d) \\
&= f(n) \cdot 1 + \sum_{d \vert n, d > 1} f(n) \cdot 0 \\
&= f(n) \\
\end{align*}
$$

### associativity, commutativity of $\star$

To prove associativity, it's better to write the formula as:
$$
(f \star g)(n) \equiv \sum_{d \vert n} f(n) g(n/d) = \sum_{xy = n} f(x) g(y)
$$

From this rewrite, it's clear that $(f \star g \star h)(n)$ will unambiguously
sum over tripes $(x, y, z)$ such that $xyz = n$. I leave the working-this-out
to you. This should also make the commutativity immediate. Summing over pairs
of the form $f(x) g(y) : xy = n$ is the same as summing over $f(y) g(x) : yx = n$.



### Existence of inverse

We can show that an inverse exists by showing that a formula for it exists; The 
idea is to construct one by induction. 

Clearly, for a given function $f$, we need the inverse $f^{-1}$ to be such that
$(f \star f^{-1})(n) = id_\star$. Hence:

$$
\begin{align*}
&(f \star f^{-1})(1) = id_\star(1) = 1 \\
&f(1) f^{-1}(1) = 1 \\
& f^{-1}(1) \equiv 1 / f(1)\\
\end{align*}
$$

Great, we have a base case; We can now compute $f^{-1}(n)$ inductively, assuming
we know the value of $f^{-1}(d)$ for all $d \vert n$.

$$
\begin{align*}
&(f \star f^{-1})(n) = id_\star(1) = 0 \\
&\sum_{d \vert n} f(d) f^{-1}(n/d) = 0 \\
&f(1) f^{-1}(n) + \sum_{d \vert n, d < n} f(d) f^{-1}(n/d) = 0
&f^{-1}(n) = \frac{-\sum_{d \vert n, d < n} f(d) f^{-1}(n/d)}{f(1)} 
\end{align*}
$$

### $\mu$ as the inverse of the $one$ function


### Mobius inversion

Now that we know that $\mu = \texttt{const 1}^{-1}$, we can use this fact
to perform _mobius inversion_:

$$
f(n) \equiv \sum_{d \vert n} g(n/d) = \texttt{const 1} \star g
$$

We have $f$ written in terms of $g$. We can now write $g$ in terms of $f$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&f(n)  = \texttt{const 1} \star g \\
&f \star \texttt{const 1}^{-1} = g \\
&g = f \star \mu \\
&g = \sum_{d \vert n} f(d) \mu(n/d)
\end{align*}
$$

### $n = \sum_{d \vert n} \phi(d)$

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
d & \{ 1 \leq x \leq 12 : (x, 12) = d \} & \{ 1 \leq x \leq 12: (x/d, 12/d) = 1\} & \text{size of set} \\
1 & \{ 1, 5, 7, 11 \} & (x, 12) = 1 & 4 \\
2 & \{2, 10 \} & (x/2, 6) = 1& 2 \\
3 & \{3, 9 \} & (x/3, 4) = 1 & 2 \\
4 & \{4, 8 \} & (x/4, 3) = 1 & 2 \\
6 & \{ 6 \} & (x/6, 2) = 1 & 1 \\
12 & \{ 12 \} (x/12, 1) = 1 & 1
\end{array}
$$

Notice that the sizes of sets that we are calculating, for example,
$|\{ 1 \leq x \leq 12 : (x/2, 6) = 1 \}| =  \phi(6)$. Summing over all of
what we have, we've counted the numbers in $[1, 2, \dots, 12]$ in two ways ---
one directly, and the other by partitioning into equivalence classes:

$$ 12 = \phi(1) + \phi(2) + \phi(3) + \phi(4) + \phi(6) + \phi(12) = \sum_{d \vert 12} \phi(12/d) $$

In general, the same argument allows us to prove that:

$$ n = \sum_{d \vert n} n/d $$

## [Incunabulum for the 21st century: Making the J interpreter compile in 2020](#incunabulum-for-the-21st-century-making-the-j-interpreter-compile-in-2020)

This is me trying to understand the fabled interpreter of the `J` language
working, so I could absorb Arthur Whitney's style of writing C: it's
cryptic, short, and fits in a page. [I learnt of this from the `J` language page](https://code.jsoftware.com/wiki/Essays/Incunabulum),
which comes with the quote:

> One summer weekend in 1989, Arthur Whitney visited Ken Iverson at Kiln Farm
> and produced—on one page and in one afternoon—an interpreter fragment on the
> AT&T 3B1 computer. I studied this interpreter for about a week for its

> four o'clock in the afternoon, wrote the first line of code that became the
> implementation described in this document.

It's a lot to take in --- it's quite breathtaking really, the way it all
hangs together in one page.

#### The attempt to get it run

Unfortunately, this does not work if we try to get it to run in 2020. I decided
to read the code and understand what would happen. I managed to read enough
to understand that the code `a=~3` ought to create an array with values `[0 1 2]`.
On attempting to _run_ this however, we get:

```

#### The lock screen

I liked it so much that I took a screenshot and made it my lock screen.

<img width=500 src="./static/screenshot-j-incunabulum.png">

#### Thoughts

I'm really fascinated by the code. I loved I could simply stare the screenshot
to absorb the code. There was no scrolling involved.  The variables are
well-named (to the extent I understand the code), and it's clearly extremely
well thought out. If there's someone who understands some of the thorny
aspects of the code:

- What is the `t` variable really tracking?
- How does one create a multi-dimensional array easily?
- What are some interesting programs one can run with this mini-interpreter?

I'd be really glad to know the details. Please leave 
[an issue or a pull request against the repo](https://github.com/bollu/bollu.github.io/issues/new).

I'm going write a dissection of the code once I fully understand it, since I
couldn't find explanaing the code on the internet.

Until then, enjoy the monolith of code!


## [An example of a sequence whose successive terms get closer together but isn't Cauchy (does not converge)](#an-example-of-a-sequence-whose-successive-terms-get-closer-together-but-isnt-cauchy-does-not-converge)

#### The problem
Provide an example of a sequence $a_n: \mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb R$
such that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \vert a_{n+1} - a_n \vert \rightarrow 0$,
but $\lim_{n, m \rightarrow \infty, m > n} |a_n - a_m| \neq 0$. That is,
proide a series where the distances between successive terms converges to zero,
but where distances between terms that are "farther apart than 1" does
not converge to 0. That is, the sequence is not _Cauchy_.

#### Regular solution: Harmonic numbers

The usual solution is to take the harmonic numbers,
$H_n \equiv \sum_{i=1}^n 1/i$. Then, we show that:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left| H_{n+1} - H_n \right|
&= \left| \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n} \right| \\
&= \frac{1}{(n+1)n} \rightarrow 0
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \left| H_{2n} - H_n \right| \\
&= \left|\frac{1}{2n} - \frac{1}{n} \right| \\
&= \sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2} + \dots + \frac{1}{2n} \\
&\geq \sum_{i=n+1}^{2n} \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{2n} + \dots + \frac{1}{2n} \\
&\geq \frac{n}{2n} = \frac{1}{2} \neq 0 \text{on} x \rightarrow \infty
\end{align*}
$$


#### Memorable solution: logarithm

We can much more simply choose $a_n = \log(n)$. This yields the simple
calculation:

$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{n+1} - a_n = \log(n+1) - \log(n)
= \log((n+1)/n))
= \log(1 + 1/n) \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} \log(1) = 0
\end{align*}
$$

while on the other hand,


$$
\begin{align*}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} a_{2n} - a_n
= \log(2n) - \log(n)
= \log(2) + \log(n) - \log(n)
= \log 2 \neq 0
\end{align*}
$$

I find this far cleaner conceptually, since it's "obvious" to everyone
that $a_n = \log(n)$ diverges, while the corresponding fact for $H_n$
is hardly convincing. We also get straightforward equalities everywhere,
instead of inequalities.

I still feel that I don't grok what precisely fails here, in that, my intuition
still feels that the local condition _ought_ to imply the Cauchy condition:
if $a_n$ tells $a_{n+1}$ to not be too far, and $a_{n+1}$ tells $a_{n+2}$,
surely this _must_ be transitive?

I have taught my instincts to not trust my instincts on analysis, which is a
shitty solution :) I hope to internalize this someday.

__EDIT:__ I feel I now understand what's precisely happening
after ruminating a bit.

The Cauchy convergence criterion allows us to drop a finite number
of terms, and then capture _everything after that point_ in a ball
of radius $\epsilon$. As $\epsilon$ shrinks, _all_ the terms in the
sequence are "squeezed togeher".

In the $a_{n+1} - a_n$ case, only successive terms must maintain
an $\epsilon$ distance. But as the $\log$ example shows, you can steadily
plod along, keeping $\epsilon$ ball next to $\epsilon$ ball, to reach:

$$
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} f(n) \cdot \epsilon
$$
whose behaviour can do unexpected things depending on the choice of $\n$.

## [Krylov subspace method](#krylov-subspace-method)

<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9DHmkCE9oI -->

This is a class of methods used to solve $Ax = b$, where $A$ is sparse.
Krylov subspace methods are a class of methods which use the idea of a
Krylov subspace. There is conjugate gradient (CG), GMRES (Generalized minimal
residual method).

$$
K_m(A, v) \equiv span \{ v, Av, A^2v, \dots, A^m v\}
$$

Clearly, $K_m \subseteq K_{m+1}$, and there is a maximum $K_N$ that we can span
(the full vector space). We are interested in the smallest index $M$
such that $K_M = K_{M+1}$.

We notice that $K_M$ is invariant under the action of $A$.


Now, let's consider:
$$
\begin{align*}
K_m(A, x) &\equiv span \{x, Ax, A^2x, \dots A^m x \} \\
        &= span \{ A^{-1} b, b, Ab, \dots A^{m-1} x \} \qquad \text{(substitute $x = A^{-1}b$)} \\
        &= A span \{ A^{-1} b, b, Ab, \dots A^{m-1} b\} \qquad \text{(Invariance of Krylov subspace)} \\
        &= span \{b, Ab, \dots A^m b\}  \\
        &= K_m(A, b)
\end{align*}
$$

We learnt that $Ax = b$ has a solution in $K_m(A, b)$. Using this, we can build
solvers that exploit the Krylov subspace. We will describe GMRES and CG.

## Generalized minimal residual --- GMRES

We wish to solve $Ax = b$ where $A$ is sparse and $b$ is normalized. The $n$th
Krylov subspace is $K_n(A, b) \equiv span~\{b, Ab, A^2b, \dots, A^nb  \}$.

We approximate the actual solution with a vector $x_n \in K_n(A, b)$. We
define the _residual_ as $r_n \equiv A x_n - b$.

## [Good reference to the Rete pattern matching algorithm](#good-reference-to-the-rete-pattern-matching-algorithm)

The [Rete pattern matching algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rete_algorithm)
is an algorithm that allows matching a huge number of rules with a huge database
of "facts".

MLIR ("multi-language intermediate representation") is a new technology that
hopes to centralize much of the research and development of various compilers
into a single authoritative source. The major claim-to-fame is that it allows
one to mix various "dialects" (much as Racket does). So, to a first order
approximation, MLIR is "JSON for compiler intermediate representations".

What MLIR gets right is _tooling_. They take the experience that the LLVM project
has mined for the last decade and a half, and bake many of the good stuff that
came with LLVM right in. For example, MLIR comes in-built with a pretty printer,
a notion of types, a notion of "attributes", SSA, enforced provenance
tracking of code (so one can _always_ know what the original source code was
that led to some assembly). Sound engineering might see MLIR succeed where
many others failed.

I was reminded of Rete since the MLIR folks are trying to solve the pattern
matching problem in general for their [Generic DAG Rewriter](https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/GenericDAGRewriter/).

They currently just use a worklist based algorithm. I'm trying to understand
if Rete can be used instead. Rete is famous for being hard to understand,
so I began a quest to look for good sources to implement it. I found a great
[PhD thesis written by Robert B. Doorenboos](http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/1995/CMU-CS-95-113.pdf),
which quips:

> Since the Rete match algorithm provides the starting point for much of the work in this thesis,
> this chapter describes Rete. Unfortunately, most of the descriptions of Rete in the literature
> are not particularly lucid,1 which is perhaps why Rete has acquired \a reputation for extreme
> differentialculty."(Perlin, 1990b) To remedy this situation, this chapter describes Rete in a tutorial
> style, rather than just briey reviewing it and referring the reader to the literature for a full
> description. We will first give an overview of Rete, and then discuss the principle data structures
> and procedures commonly used to implement it. High-level pseudocode will be given for many
> of the structures and procedures, so that this chapter may serve as a guide to readers who want
> to implement rete (or some variant) in their own systems.

I now have a reference to an accessible description of this stuff. I might
implement Rete to understand it, so that it's part of my toolkit if I ever
need it.

## [Leapfrog Integration](#leapfrog-integration)

We have a system we wish to simulate using hamilton's equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}|_{(p_0, q_0)} \\
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}|_{(p_0, q_0)} \\
\end{align*}
$$

We want to simulate a system using these differential equations. We will begin
with some initial position and momentum $(q_0, p_0)$, evaluate
$\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} \rvert_{(q_0, p_0)}$, $\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} \rvert_{(q_0, p_0)}$, and use
these to find $(q_{next}, p_{next})$. An integrator is a general algorithm
that produces the next position and momentum using current information:

$$
(q_{next}, p_{next}) =
  I \left(q_0,
    p_0,
    \frac{\partial q}{\partial t}\rvert_{(q_0, p_0)},
    \frac{\partial p}{\partial t}\rvert_{(q_0, p_0)} \right)
$$

The design of $I$ is crucial: different choices of $I$ will have different
trade-offs for accuracy and performance. Another interesting property
we might want is for $I$ to be a _symplectic integrator_ --- that is,
it preserves the total energy of the system. For example, here's a plot
of the orbits of planets using two integrators, one that's symplectic (leapfrog)
and one that isn't (Euler)


<img width=400  src="./static/leapfrog-vs-euler.png">

Notice that since leapfrog attempts to keep energy conserved, the orbits stay
as orbits! On the other hand, the euler integrator quickly spirals out, since
we lose energy during the integration. Note that this is 
_not an issue of numerical precision_: The euler integrator is ineherently 
such that over long timescales, it will lose energy. On the other hand, the
leapfrog integrator will _always remain stable_, even with very large timesteps
and low precision.

I present the equations of the leapfrog integrator, a proof sketch that it
is symplectic, and the code listing that was used to generate the above plot.
Often, code makes most ideas very clear!

#### The integrator


#### Code listing

##### Incantations
```py
## Run HMC with a particular choice of potential
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy.linalg
```

```py
## dq/dt = dH/dp|_{p0, q0}
## dp/dt = -dH/dq|_{p0, q0}
def leapfrog(dhdp, dhdq, q0, p0, dt):
    p0 += -dhdq(q0, p0) * 0.5 * dt

    # full step position
    # q += dt * p
    q0 += dhdp(q0, p0) * dt

    # half step position
    p0 += -dhdq(q0, p0) * 0.5 * dt
    return (q0, p0)
```

For reference, we also implement an euler integrator, that uses the derivative
to compute the position and momentum of the next timestep independently.

```py
def euler(dhdp, dhdq, q, p, dt):
    pnew = p + -dhdq(q, p) * dt
    qnew = q + dhdp(q, p) * dt
    return (qnew, pnew)
```


Finally, we implement `planet(integrator, n, dt)` which simulates gravitational
potential and usual kinetic energy, using the integrator given by `integrator`
for `n` steps, with each timestep taking `dt`.

```py
def planet(integrator, n, dt):
    STRENGTH = 0.5

    # minimise potential V(q): q, K(p, q) p^2
    q = np.array([0.0, 1.0])
    p = np.array([-1.0, 0.0])

    # H = STRENGTH * |q| (potential) + p^2/2 (kinetic)
    def H(qcur, pcur): return STRENGTH * np.linalg.norm(q) + np.dot(p, p) / 2
    def dhdp(qcur, pcur): return p
    def dhdq(qcur, pcur): return STRENGTH * 2 * q / np.linalg.norm(q)

    qs = []
    for i in range(n):
        print("q: %10s | p: %10s | H: %6.4f" % (q, p, H(q, p)))
        (q, p) = integrator(dhdp, dhdq, q, p, dt)
        qs.append(q.copy())
    return np.asarray(qs)
```


We plot the simulations using `matplotlib` and save them.
```py
NITERS = 15
TIMESTEP = 1

print("planet simulation with leapfrog")
planet_leapfrog = planet(leapfrog, NITERS, TIMESTEP)

plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 12, 'font.family':'monospace'})
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
print(planet_leapfrog)
ax.plot(planet_leapfrog[:, 0], planet_leapfrog[:, 1], label='leapfrog',
        linewidth=3, color='#00ACC1')
print("planet simulation with euler")
planet_euler = planet(euler, NITERS, TIMESTEP)
ax.plot(planet_euler[:, 0], planet_euler[:, 1], label='euler',
        linewidth=3, color='#D81B60')

legend = plt.legend(frameon=False)
ax.set_title("leapfrog v/s euler: NITERS=%s dt=%s" % (NITERS, TIMESTEP))
ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
ax.spines['right'].set_visible(False)
ax.spines['bottom'].set_visible(False)
ax.spines['left'].set_visible(False)
plt.savefig("leapfrog-vs-euler.png")
plt.show()
```

## [Comparison of forward and reverse mode AD](#comparison-of-forward-and-reverse-mode-ad)

Quite a lot of ink has been spilt on this topic. My favourite reference
is the one by [Rufflewind](https://rufflewind.com/2016-12-30/reverse-mode-automatic-differentiation).

However, none of these examples have a good stock of examples for the diference.
So here, I catalogue the explicit computations between computing forward
mode AD and reverse mode AD.

In general, in forward mode AD, we fix how much the inputs wiggle with
respect to a parameter $t$. We figure out how much the output wiggles
with respect to $t$. If $output = f(input_1, input_2, \dots input_n)$,
then $\frac{\partial output}{\partial t} = \sum_i \frac{\partial f}{\partial input_i} \frac{\partial input_i}{\partial dt}$.

In reverse mode AD, we fix how much the parameter $t$ wiggles with
respect to the output. We figure out how much the parameter $t$
wiggles with respect to the inputs.
If $output_i = f_i(input, \dots)$, then $\frac{\partial t}{\partial input} = \sum_i \frac{\partial t}{\partial output_i} \frac{\partial f_i}{input}$.
This is a much messier expression, since we need to accumulate the data
over all outputs.

Essentially, deriving output from input is easy, since how to compute an output
from an input is documented in one place. deriving input from output is
annoying, since many outputs can depent on a single output.

The upshot is that if we have few "root outputs" (like a loss function),
we need to run AD once with respect to this, and we will get the wiggles
of _all inputs_ at the same time with respect to this output, since we
compute the wiggles output to input.

The first example of `z = max(x, y)` captures the essential difference
between the two approached succinctly. Study this, and everything else will make
sense.


#### Maximum: `z = max(x, y)`


- Forward mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= max(x, y) \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}
  &= \begin{cases}
        \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} & \text{if $x > y$} \\
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} & \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

We can compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ by setting $t = x$.
That is, $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = 1, \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = 0$.
Similarly, can compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$ by setting $t = y$.
That is, $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = 1, \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = 0$.
If we want both gradients $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$,
we will have to **rerun the above equations twice** with the two initializations.

In our equations, we are saying that we know how sensitive
the inputs $x, y$ are to a given parameter $t$. We are deriving how sensitive
the output $z$ is to the parameter $t$ as a composition of $x, y$. If
$x > y$, then we know that $z$ is as sensitive to $t$ as $x$ is.


- Reverse mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= max(x, y) \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial z} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial x}
  &= \begin{cases}
    \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} & \text{$if x > y$} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial y}
  &= \begin{cases}
    \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} & \text{$if y > x$} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$

We can compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}$
**in one shot** by setting $t = z$. That is, $\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = 1$.

In our equations, we are saying that we know how sensitive
the parameter $t$ is to a given output $z$. We are trying to see
how sensitive $t$ is to the inputs $x, y$. If $x$ is active (ie, $x > y$),
then $t$ is indeed sensitive to $x$ and $\frac{\partial t}{\partial x} = 1$.
Otherwise, it is not sensitive, and $\frac{\partial t}{\partial x} = 0$.


#### sin: `z = sin(x)`

- Forward mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= sin(x) \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}
  &= \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} \\
  &= cos(x) \frac{\partial x}{\partial t}
\end{align*}
$$

We can compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ by setting $t = x$.
That is, setting $\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = 1$.

- Reverse mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= sin(x) \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial z} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial x}
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \\
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} cos(x)
\end{align*}
$$


We can compute $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ by setting $t = z$.
That is, setting $\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} = 1$.

#### addition: `z = x + y`:

- Forward mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= x + y \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}
  &= \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} +
    \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \\
  &= 1 \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + 1 \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
  = \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
\end{align*}
$$


- Reverse mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= x + y \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial z} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial x}
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \\
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \cdot 1 = \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial y}
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \\
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \cdot 1 = \frac{\partial t}{\partial z}
\end{align*}
$$


#### multiplication: `z = xy`

- Forward mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= x y \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}
  &= \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} +
    \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \\
  &= y \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} + x \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
\end{align*}
$$

- Reverse mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= x y \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial z} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial x}
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial x}
  = \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \cdot y \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial y}
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial y}
  = \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \cdot x
\end{align*}
$$


#### subtraction: `z = x - y`:

- Forward mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= x + y \\
\frac{\partial x}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial t}
  &= \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} -
    \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \frac{\partial y}{\partial t} \\
  &= 1 \cdot \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} - 1 \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
  = \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} - \frac{\partial y}{\partial t}
\end{align*}
$$

- Reverse mode equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
z &= x - y \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial z} &= ? \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial x}
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \\
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \cdot 1 = \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \\
\frac{\partial t}{\partial y}
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \\
  &= \frac{\partial t}{\partial z} \cdot -1 = -\frac{\partial t}{\partial z}
\end{align*}
$$


## [An invitation to homology and cohomology, Part 1 --- Homology](#an-invitation-to-homology-and-cohomology-part-1--homology)

There are many introductions to homology on the internet, but none of them
really met my criteria for being simple, picture filled, and getting the
basic ideas across. I feel that Hatcher might come closest to what I want
(and where I originally learnt the material), but their description of homology
is surrounded by the context of Algebraic Topology, while really, simplicial
homology is accessible to anyone who has seen some linear algebra and group
theory. This is my attempt to get the ideas across.

Let's first try to understand what we're trying to do here. We want to detect
holes in a space, broadly construed. We focus in _simplicial complexes_, which
are collections of triangles and triangle-like objects in higher (and lower)
dimensions. We define what holes are for these simplicial complexes, and we then
try to find algebraic objects that allow us to "detect" these holes.

### Simplices

- A 0-simplex is a point

<img src="static/simplices/0-simplex.svg">

- A 1-simplex is a line

<img src="static/simplices/1-simplex.svg">

- A 2-simplex is a filled triangle

<img src="static/simplices/2-simplex.svg">


- A 3-simplex is a solid tetrahedra

<img src="static/simplices/3-simplex.svg">

- A $k$-dimensional simplex is the convex hull of $k+1$
  linearly independent points $(u_i \in \mathbb R^{k+1})$
  in $k+1$ dimensional space.
  $ S_k \equiv \left \\{ \sum \theta_i u_i ~\mid~ \theta_i \geq 0, ~ \sum_i \theta_i = 1 \right\\} $

### Simplicial complexes

A simplicial complex $K$ is a collection of simplices where:
- (1) Every boundary of a simplex from $K$ is in $K$
- (2) The intersection of any two simplices in $K$ is also in $K$

Examples of simplicial complexes:

- Every simplex is trivially a simplicial complex.

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/complex-0-simplices.svg">
- A collection of points is a simplicial complex with all simplices of degree $0$.

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/complex-unfilled-triangle.svg">
- An unfilled triangle is a simplicial complex with simplices of degree $0$, $1$.

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/complex-unfilled-butterfly.svg">
- Non-triangular shapes such  as this "butterfly" are also simplicial complexes,
  this one of degree $0$, $1$.

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/complex-half-filled-butterfly.svg">
- This is the same shape as the unfilled butterly, except now containing a
  simplex of degree 2: the filling in of the bottom of the butterfly.


Non-examples of simplicial complexes are:

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/non-simplex-1.svg">
- This does not contain the point at the lower-left corner, which should exist
  since it is a boundary of the straight line. This violates rule (1):
  Every boundary of a simplex from $K$ is in $K$


<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/non-simplex-2.svg">
- This does not contain the points which are at the intersection of the
  triangle and the line. This violates rule (2):
  The intersection of any two simplices in $K$ is also in $K$.

### Holes in a space: Homology of a triangle

Let's consider the simplest possible case of computing the homlogy, and we
do so, we will expand on what homology _is_, and what we're trying to do.

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/homology-triangle-edges.svg">

Look at the triangle above. We have the red, green, and blue vertices, which
I'll notate $r, g, b$. We also have the edges that are orange ($o$), cyan ($c$), and
magenta ($m$).

What we are interested in doing is to be able to detect the "hole" in the
triangle in between the edges `o-m-c`. That is, we want some algorithm which
when offered the representation of the triangle, can somehow detect the hole.
Note that the hole doesn't really depend on the length of the edges. We can
"bend and stretch" the triangle, and the hole will still exist. The only way
to destroy the hole is to either _cut_ the triangle, or _fill in_ the triangle.

We first need to agree on an abstract _representation_ of the triangle,
which ideally does not change if we were to stretch out the edges,
before we can discuss how we can detect the existence of the hole.

##### Representation of the triangle: boundary operators

We first describe the shape of the triangle in terms
of two sets, $E$ and $V$ representing the edges and the vertices, and
a function $\partial_{EV}$, called as the
boundary operator, which tells us how edges
are glued to vertices.

We first have a ground set of edges $E \equiv \\{o, m, c\\}$ and a set of
vertices $V \equiv \\{r, g, b \\}$.

What we now need is to know how the edges are connected to the vertices,
since that's what really makes a triangle. We would like to say something
like "the boundary of the edge $o$ has points $r, g$". In fact, we have
slightly more information than that: the _orientation_. So what we
really ought to be saying is "the edge $o$ points from $g$ to $r$".

To do this, we create a map from $o$ to $r - g$, where we think of $o$
as a "vector", pointing from $g$ to $r$. But hang on, what _is_ $r - g$?
we don't have a mathematical structure on $V$ that lets us add and subtract
vertices. So, we _create_ a new set $\mathcal V$, which represents linear
combinations of vertices in $V$. Similarly, anticipating some future
development, we also _create_ a new set $\mathcal E$ of linear combinations
of edges $E$.

##### Formal definition of the boundary operator

We define $\mathcal E \equiv \mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$
that represents linear combinations of edges. For example, $(1, 2, 3) \in \mathcal E$
represents $o + 2m + 3c$ --- that is, take 1 copy of the orange edge, 2
copies of the magenta edge, and 3 copies of the cyan edge.

We define $\mathcal V \equiv \mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$
which represents linear combinations of vertices. For example,
$(1, -1, 2) \in V$ represents $r - g + 2b$ --- that is, take a copy of the
red vertex, subtract the green vertex, and add two copies of the blue vertex.

The boundary operator $\partial_{EV}: \mathcal{E} \rightarrow \mathcal V$ is
depicted in the picture. This operator sends edges to their _boundary_, and is
therefore called the _boundary operator_.  The _boundary_ of an edge describes
the edge in terms of vertices, just like we would describe a direction vector
(to borrow physics parlance) by subtracting points.

The action of the operator on a linear combination of edges is:

$$
\begin{align*}
&\partial_{EV}: \mathcal E \rightarrow \mathcal V \\
&\partial_{EV}(1, 0, 0) \equiv (1, -1, 0) \qquad o \mapsto r - g \\
&\partial_{EV}(0, 1, 0) \equiv (-1, 0, 1) \qquad m \mapsto b - r \\
&\partial_{EV}(0, 0, 1) \equiv (0, 1, -1) \qquad c \mapsto b - g \\
&\text{(Extend using linearity)} \\
&\partial_{EV}(s, t, u) \equiv
  s \partial_{EV}(1, 0, 0) +
  t \partial_{EV}(0, 1, 0) +
  u \partial_{EV}(0, 0, 1) = (s - t, u - s, t - u)
\end{align*}
$$

Now, notice that to traverse the cycle, we should traverse the orange edge,
then the magenta edge, then the cyan edge, in that direction. That is,
the cycle can be thought of as $o + m + c$. However, how do we _detect_ this
cycle? The key idea is that if we look at the
_image of the cycle $o + m + c$ under the boundary operator_ $\partial_{EV}$,
we will get $0$! For us to have completed a cycle, we must have both
entered and exited each vertex, so the total sum must be $0$.

Formally:

$$
\begin{align*}
  &\partial_{EV}(s, t, u) \equiv (s - t, u - s, t - u) \\
  &o + m + c = (1, 1, 1) \in \mathcal E \quad
  \partial_{EV}((1, 1, 1) = (1 - 1, 1 - 1, 1 - 1) = (0, 0, 0)
\end{align*}
$$

##### Formal definition of cycles

This is very nice, since we have converted the topological invariant
of a _hole in the space_ into an algebraic invariant of "linear combination
of edges that map to 0". That is, we want to consider all thoose loops
that belong to the _kernel_ of $\partial_{EV}$. (Terminology:
the kernel of a linear transformation is the set of all things in the domain
which map to zero)

So, we define (tentatively) the first homology group:

$$
\begin{align*}
H_1 \equiv Kernel(\partial_{EV}) \equiv
\left \{ (a, b, c) \in \mathcal E \mid \partial_EV((a, b, c)) = (0, 0, 0) \right \}
\subset \mathcal E
\end{align*}
$$

If we try to compute this, we will have to have:

$$
\begin{align*}
H_1 &\equiv Kernel(\partial_{EV}) \\
&= \{ (s, t, u) ~\mid~ \partial_{EV}(s, t, u) = (0, 0, 0) ~ s, t, u \in \mathbb Z \} \\
&= \{ (s, t, u) ~\mid~ (s-t, u-s, t-u) = (0, 0, 0) ~ s, t, u \in \mathbb Z  \} \\
&= \{ (s, t, u) ~\mid~ s = t = u \quad s, t, u \in \mathbb Z \} \\
&= \{ (x, x, x) ~\mid~ x \in \mathbb Z \} \simeq \mathbb Z
\end{align*}
$$

So, we know that we have a $\mathbb Z$ worth of cycles in our triangle, which
makes sense: We can go clockwise (positive numbers)
and counter-clockwise (negative numbers) around the triangle,
and we can go as many times as we wish, so we have $\mathbb Z$ as the
number of cycles.

that is, it's the linear combination of edges that map to zero through the
boundary map. Note that this also includes combinations such as _two_ loops
around the triangle, such as $o + m + c + o + m + c$.

### (No) Holes in a space: Homology of a _filled_ triangle

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/homology-triangle-faces.svg">

In this case, notice that the triangle is _filled_ with a face $f$.
Therefore, the "hole" that we had previously is now filled up, and does not
count anymore. So, we now need to amend our previous definition of $H_1$ to
kill the hole we had detected.

The idea is that the hole we had previously is now the
_boundary of the new face $f$_.
Since it is the boundary of a "filled in" region, it does not count anymore,
since we can "shrink the hole" across the face to make it a non-loop.
Hence, we need to quotient our $H_1$ with the boundary of the face.

Formally, what we do is we create another group $\mathcal F \equiv \mathbb Z$,
which counts copies of our face $f$, and we define another boundary operator,
such that the boundary of the face $f$ is $o + m + c$.

$$
\begin{align*}
&\partial_{FE} : \mathcal F \rightarrow \mathcal E \\
&\partial_{FE}(1) \equiv (1, 1, 1)  \\
&\text{(Extend using linearity)} \\
&\partial_{FE}(c) \equiv c \partial(1) = (c, c, c)
\end{align*}
$$

Now, we should notice that the _image_ of $\partial_{FE}$ is a loop
$(o + m + c)$, which lies ie the _kernel_ of $\partial_{EV}$. This is a
general feature of homology, so it bears repeating:

- $Image(\partial_{FE}) \subset Kernel(\partial_{EV})$
- $\partial_{FE} \circ \partial_{EV} = 0$
- The above equation is sometimes stylishly (somewhat misleadingly) written as
  $\partial^2 = 0$. More faithfully, one can write $\partial_{EV} \circ \partial_{FE} = 0$.

Now, since the image of $\partial_{FE}$ lies entirely in the kernel of $\partial_{EV}$,
we can construct $H_1$ as:

- $H_1 \equiv Kernel(\partial_{EV}) / Image(\partial_{FE}) \subset E$


### A complicated space: Homology of a butterfly


## [An invitation to homology and cohomology, Part 2 --- Cohomology](#an-invitation-to-homology-and-cohomology-part-2--cohomology)

<!--
f is closed <=> df = 0
f is exact <=> f = dg
-->

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/cohomology-triangle-vertices.svg">

Once again, we have our humble triangle with vertices $V = \{r, g, b\}$,
edges $E = \{o, m, c \}$, faces $F = \{ f \}$ with boundary maps $\partial_{EV}$,
$\partial_{FE}$:

- $\partial_{FE}(f)= o + m + c$
- $\partial_{EV}(o) = r - g$
- $\partial_{EV}(m) = b - r$
- $\partial_{EV}(c)= g - b$

We define a function $h_v: V \rightarrow \mathbb R$ on the vertices as:
-  $h_v(r) = 3$, $h_v(g) = 4$, $h_v(b) = 10$.

We now learn how to _extend_ this function to the higher dimensional objects,
the edges and the faces of the triangle.

To extend this function to the edges, we define a new function:

- $h_e: E \rightarrow R$
- $h_e(e) \equiv \sum_i \alpha_i h_v(v_i)$ where $\partial_{EV} e = \sum_i \alpha_i v_i$

Expanded out on the example, we evaluate $h_v$ as:

- $h_e(o) \equiv d h_v(o)  = h_v(r) - h_v(g) = 3 - 4 = -1$
- $h_e(m) \equiv d h_v(m)  = h_v(b) - h_v(r) = 10 - 3 = +7$
- $h_e(c) \equiv d h_v(c)  = h_v(g) - h_v(b) = 4 - 10 = -6$

More conceptually, we have created an _operator_ called $d$ (the **coboundary operator**)
which takes functions defined on vertices to functions defined on edges. This
uses the boundary map on the edges to "lift" a function on the vertices to a
function on the edges.  It does so by assigning the "potential difference" of
the vertices to the edges.


- $d: (V \rightarrow \mathbb R) \rightarrow (E \rightarrow \mathbb R)$
- $d(h_v) \equiv h_e$, $h_e(e) \equiv \sum_i \alpha_i f(v_i)$ where $\partial_{EV} e = \sum_i \alpha_i v_i$


We can repeat the construction we performed above, to construct another operator
$d : (E \rightarrow \mathbb R) \rightarrow (F \rightarrow \mathbb R)$, defined
in _exactly the same way_ as we did before. For example, we can evaluate:

- $h_f \equiv d(h_e)$
- $h_f(f) \equiv d h_e(f) = h_e(o) + h_e(m) + h_e(c) = -1 + 7 -6 = 0$

What we have is a chain:

- $h_v \xrightarrow{d} h_e \xrightarrow{d} h_f$

Where we notice that $d^2 = d \circ d = 0$, since the function $h_f$ that we have gotten
evaluates to zero on the face $f$. We can prove this will happen _in general_,
for any choice of $h_v$.
(it's a good exercise in definition chasing).


Introducing some terminology, A differential form $f$ is said to be a **closed differential form**
iff $df = 0$.

In our case, $h_e$ **is closed**, since $d h_e = h_f = 0$. On the other hand
$h_v$ is **not closed**, since $d h_v = h_e \neq 0$.

The intuition for why this is called "closed" is that its coboundary vanishes.

## Exploring the structure of functions defined on the edges

Here, we try to understand what functions defined on the edges can look like,
and their relationship with the $d$ operator. We discover that there are
some functions $g_e: E \rightarrow \mathbb R$ which can be realised as the differential
of another function $g_v: V \rightarrow \mathbb R$. The differential
forms such as $g_e$ which can be generated a $g_v$ through the $d$ operator
are called as **exact differential forms**. That is, $g_e = d g_v$ _exactly_,
such that there is no "remainder term" on applying the $d$ operator.

<img width=200 height=200 src="static/simplices/cohomology-triangle-edges.svg">

We take an example of a differential form that is _not exact_, which has been
defined on the edges of the triangle above. Let's call it $h_e$.

It is defined on the edges as:
- $h_e(c) = 3$
- $h_e(m) = 2$
- $h_e(o) = 1$

We can calcuate $h_f = d h_e$ the same way we had before:
- $h_f(f) \equiv d h_e(f) = h_e(o) + h_e(m) + h_e(c) = 3 + 1 + 2 = 6$.

Since $d h_e \neq 0$, this form is not exact.

Let's also try to generate $h_e$ from a potential. We arbitrarily fix the
potential of $b$ to $0$. That is, we fix $h_v(b) = 0$, and we then try to
see what values we are forced to values of $h_v$ across the rest of the triangle.

- $h_v b = 0$
- $h_e(c) = h_v(g) - h_v(b)$. $h_v(g) =  h_v(b) + h_e(c) = 0 + 3 = 3$.
- $h_e(o) = h_v(r) - h_v(g)$. $h_v(r) =  h_v(g) + h_e(o) = 3 + 1 = 4$.
- $h_e(m) = h_v(b) - h_v(r)$ $2 = 0 - 4$. This is a contradiction!
- Ideally, we need $h_v(b) = 6$ for the values to work out.


Hence, there can exist no such $h_v$ such that $h_e \equiv d h_v$.
The interesting thing is, when we started out by assigning $h_v(b) = 0$,
we could make _local choices_ of potentials that seemed like they would fit
together, but they failed to fit _globally_ throughout the triangle. This
failure of _locally consistent choices_ to be _globally consistent_ is
the essence of cohomology.

## Cohomology of half-filled butterfly

<img width=400 src="static/simplices/cohomology-half-filled-butterfly.svg">

Here, we have vertices $V \equiv \\{ r, g, b, b, p \\}$, edges
$E \equiv \\{rb, gr, bg, m, o, c \\}$ and faces $F \equiv \\{ f \\}$.

Here, we see a differential form $h_e$ that is defined on the edges,
and also obeys the equation $dh_e = 0$ (Hence is closed). However, it
_does not have an associated potential energy_ to derive it from. That is,
there cannot exist a certain $h_v$ such that $d h_v = h_e$.


So, while every exact form is closed, _not every_ closed form is exact.

Hence, this $g$ that we have found is a non-trivial element of $Kernel(d_{FE}) / Image(d_{EV})$,
since $dh_e = 0$, hence $h_e \in Kernel(d_{FE})$, while there does not exist
a $h_v$ such that $d h_v = h_e$, hence it is _not quotiented_ by the image of
$d_{EV}$.

So the failure of the space to be fully filled in (ie, the space has a hole),
is measured by the _existence of a function $h_e$ that is closed but not exact!_

This reveals a deep connection between homology and cohomology, which is
made explicit by the [Universal Coefficient Theorem](TODO)

## [Stuff I learnt in 2019](#stuff-i-learnt-in-2019)

I write these retrospective blog posts every year since 2017. I tend to post a
collection of papers, books, and ideas I've stumbled across that year.
Unfortunately, this year, the paper list will be sparser, since I lost some
data along the way to the year, and hence I don't have links to everything I
read. So this is going to be a sparser list, consisting of things that I found
_memorable_.

I also re-organised my website, letting the link die, since keeping it up was
taking far too many cycles (In particular, CertBot was far too annoying to
maintain, and the feedback of hugo was also very annoying). I now have a
_single_ file, the
[`README.md`of the `bollu/bollu.github.io`](https://github.com/bollu/bollu.github.io)
repo,
to which I add notes on things I find interesting. I've bound the `i` alias
(for idea) on all my shells everywhere, to open the `README.md` file, wait
for me to write to it, run a `git commit` so I can type out a commit, and
then push. This has been _massive_ for what I manage to write down: I feel
like I've managed to write down a lot of one-liners / small facts that I've
picked up which I would not otherwise. I'm attempting to similarly pare down
other friction-inducing parts of my workflow. Suggestions here would be very
welcome!


If there's a theme of the year (insofar as my scattered reading has a
theme...), it's "lattices and geometry". Geometry in terms of differential
geometry, topology, and topoi. Lattices in the sense of a bunch of abstract
interpretation and semantics.

#### Course work: optimisation theory, quantum computation, statistics

My course work was less interesting to me this time, due to the fact that I had
chosen to study some wild stuff earlier on, and now have to take reasonable stuff
to graduate. However, there were courses that filled in a lot of gaps in my
self-taught knowledge for me, and the ones I listed were the top ones in that
regard.

I wound up reading
[Boyd on optimisation theory](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/),
[Nielsen and Chuang](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf) for quantum computation,
where I also
[solved a bunch of exercises in Q#](https://github.com/bollu/quantum-course-exercises)
which was very fun and rewarding. I'm beginning to feel that learning quantum
computation is the right route to grokking things like entanglement and
superposition, unlike the physics which is first of all much harder due to
infinite dimensionality, and less accessible since we can't _program_ it.

#### Formal research work: Compilers, Formal verification, Programming languages

My research work is on the above topics, so I try to stay abreast of what's
going on in the field. What I've read over the past year on these topics is:


- [`A^2I`: meta-abstract interpretation](https://popl19.sigplan.org/details/POPL-2019-Research-Papers/71/A-2-I-Abstract-2-Interpretation).
  This paper extends the theory of abstract interpretation to perform abstract
  interpretation on program analyses themselves. I'm not sure how _useful_ this
  is going to be, as I still hold on to the belief that AI as a framework is
  too general to allow one to prove complex results. But I am still interested
  in trying to adapt this to some problems I have at hand. Perhaps it's going
  to work.


- [Cubicial Agda](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3341691). This paper introduces
  cubical type theory and its implementation in Agda. It appears to solve many
  problems that I had struggled with during my formalization of loop
  optimisations: In particular, dealing with Coinductive types in Coq, and that
  of defining quotient types / setoids. Supposedly, cubical Agda makes dealing
  with Coinduction far easier. It allows allows the creation of "real" quotient
  types that respect equality, without having to deal with `setoid` style
  objects that make for large Gallina terms. I don't fully understand how the
  _theory_ works: In particular, as far as I can tell, the synthetic interval
  type `I` allows one to only access the start and end points (`0` and `1`),
  but not anything in between, so I don't really see how it allows for
  interpolation.  I also don't understand how this allows us to make Univalence
  computable.  I feel I need to practice with this new technology before I'm
  well versed, but it's definitely a paper I'm going to read many, many times
  till I grok it.


- [Naive Cubical type theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05844). This paper
  promises a way to perform informal reasoning with cubical type theory, the
  way we are able to do so with, say, a polymorphic type theory for lambda
  calculus. The section names such as "how do we think of paths",
  "what can we do with paths", inspire confidence

- [Call by need is Clairvoyant call by value](https://icfp19.sigplan.org/details/icfp-2019-papers/26/Call-By-Need-is-Clairvoyant-Call-By-Value). This key insight is to notice that call by need
  is "just" call by value, when we evaluate only those values that are
  eventually forced, and throw away the rest. Thus, if we had an oracle that
  tells us which values are eventually forced, we can convert call by need into
  call by value, relative to this oracle. This cleans up many proofs in the
  literature, and might make it far more intuitive to teach call by need to
  people as well. Slick paper, I personally really enjoyed reading this.

- [Shift/Reset the Penultimate Backpropagator](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10228)
  This paper describes how to implement backprop using delimited continuations.
  Also, supposedly, using staging / building a compiler out of this paradigm
  allows one to write high performance compilers for backprop without having
  to suffer, which is always nice.


- [Closed forms for numerical loops](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/popl19a.pdf)
  This paper introduces a new algebra of polynomials with exponentials. It then
  studies the eigenvalues of the matrix that describes the loop, and tries to
  find closed forms in terms of polynomials and exponentials. They choose
  to only work with rationals, but not extensions of rational numbers
  (in terms of field extensions of the rationals). Supposedly, this is easier
  to implement and reason about. Once again, this is a paper I'd like to
  reimplement to understand fully, but the paper is well-done!


- [Composable, sound transformations of Nested recursion and loops](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Papers/Sundararajah.pdf).
  This paper attempts to bring ideas from polyhedral compilation
  into working with nested recursion. They create a representation using
  multitape finite automata, using which they provide a representation for
  nested recursion. I was somewhat disappointed that it does not handle
  mutual recursion, since my current understanding is that one can always
  convert nested recursion into a "reasonable" straight line program by
  simply inlining calls and then re-using polyhedral techniques.


- [Reimplementation of `STOKE` at `bollu/blaze`.](https://github.com/bollu/blaze/blob/master/notebooks/tutorial.ipynb)
  I reimplemented the [STOKE: stochastic superoptimisation](http://stoke.stanford.edu/)
  paper, and much to my delight, it was super-effective at regenerating common
  compiler transformations. I want to use this to generate loop optimisations
  as well, by transforming a polyhedral model of the original program.


#### Internship at [Tweag.io](http://tweag.io/) over the summer: Hacking on Asterius (Haskell -> WebAssembly compiler)

- [Blog post on the progress made by me hacking on Austerius over at Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/posts/2019-09-12-webassembly-internship.html)

I really enjoyed my time at Tweag! It was fun, and
[Shao Cheng](https://github.com/TerrorJack)
was a great mentor. I must admit that I was somewhat distracted, by all the new
and shiny things I was learning thanks to all the cool people there `:)` In
particular, I wound up bugging
[Arnaud Spiwack](http://assert-false.net/arnaud/),
[Simeon Carstens](http://simeon-carstens.com/),
and [Matthias Meschede](https://github.com/mmesch)
quite a bit, about type theory, MCMC sampling, and signal processing of storm
clouds.

I wound up reading a decent chunk of GHC source code, and while I can't link
to specifics here, I understood a lot of the RTS much better than I did before.
It was an enlightening experience, to say the least, and being paid to hack on
a GHC backend was a really fun way to spend the summer.

It also led me to fun discoveries, such as
[how does one debug debug info?](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/535a26c90f458801aeb1e941a3f541200d171e8f/compiler/cmm/Debug.hs#L458)


I also really loved Paris as a city. My AirBnb host was a charming artist who
suggest spots for me around the city, which I really appreciated. Getting
around was disorienting for the first week or so, due to the fact that I could
not (and still do not) really understand how to decide in which direction to
walk inside the subways to find a particular line 
_going in a particular direction_.

The city has some great spots for quiet work, though! In particular, the
[Louvre Anticafe](https://www.anticafe.eu/lieux/louvre-paris-75001/)
was a really nice place to hang out and grab coffee. The model is great: you
pay for hours spent at the Anticafe, with coffee and snacks free. They also
had a discount for students which I gratefully used.
I bumped into interesting artists, programmers, and students who were open for
conversation there. I highly recommend hanging out there.

#### Probabilistic programming & giving a talk at FunctionalConf

This was the first talk I'd ever given, and it was on probabilistic programming
in haskell. In particular, I explained the
[`monad-bayes`](https://github.com/adscib/monad-bayes) approach of
doing this, and why this was profitable.
[The slides are available here](https://github.com/bollu/functionalconf-2019-slides-probabilistic-programming/blob/master/slides.pdf).


It was a fun experience giving a talk, and I'd like to do more of it, since I
got a lot out of attempting to explain the ideas to people. I wish I had more
time, and had a clearer idea of who the audience was. I got quite a bit of
help from [Michael Snoyman](https://www.snoyman.com/) to whip the talk into
shape, which I greatly appreciated.

The major ideas of probabilistic programming as I described it are
from Adam Scibior's thesis:

- [Adam Scibior: Formally justified and modular Bayesian inference for probabilistic programs](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~ascibior/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf)

Along the way, I and others at tweag read the other major papers in the space,
including:

- [Church, a language for generative models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3255),
  which is nice since it describes it's semantics in terms of sampling. This is
  unlike Adam's thesis, where they define the denotational semantics in terms
  of measure theory, which is then approximated by sampling.
- [Riemann Manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/16c5/06c5bb253f7528ddcc80c72673fabf584f32.pdf)
  which describes how to perform Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on the 
  _information geometry_ manifold.  So, for example, if we are trying to sample 
  from gaussians, we sample from a 2D Riemannian manifold with parameters mean 
  and varince, and metric as the [Fisher information metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric).
  This is philosophically the "correct" manifold to sample from, since it
  represents the intrinsic geometry of the space we want to sample from.
- [An elementary introduction to Information geometry by Frank Nielsen](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08271.pdf)
  something I stumbled onto as I continued reading about sampling from
  distributions. The above description about the "correct" manifold for
  gaussians comes from this branch of math, but generalises it quite a bit
  further. I've tried to reread it several times as I gradually gained maturity
  in differential geometry. I can't say I understand it just yet, but I hope to
  do so in a couple of months. I need more time for sure to meditate on the
  objects.
- [Reimplementation of `monad-bayes`](https://github.com/bollu/shakuni).
  This repo holds the original implementation on which the talk is based on.
  I read through the `monad-bayes` source code, and then re-implemented the
  bits I found interesting. It was a nice exercise, and you can see
  the git history tell a tale of my numerous mis-understandings of MCMC methods,
  till I finally got what the hell was going on.

#### Presburger Arithmetic

Since we use a bunch of [presburger arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic)
for [polyhedral compilation](http://polyhedral.info/)
which is a large research interest of mine, I've been trying to build a
"complete" understanding of this space. So this time, I wanted to learn
how to build good solvers:

- [`bollu/gutenberger`](https://github.com/bollu/gutenberger) is a decision
  procedure for Presburger arithmetic that exploits their encoding as finite
  automata. One thing that I was experimenting with was that we only use
  numbers of finite bit-width, so we can explore the entire state space
  of the automata and then perform NFA reduction using
  [DFA minimisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization). The
  reference I used for this was the excellent textbook
  [Automata theory: An algorithmic approach, Chapter 10](https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/autoskript.pdf)
- [The taming of the semi-linear set](http://www.lsv.fr/~haase/documents/ch16.pdf)
  This uses a different encoding of presburger sets, which allows them to bound
  a different quantity (the norm) rather than the bitwidth descriptions. This allows
  them to compute _exponentially_ better bounds for some operations than
  were known before, which is quite cool. This is a paper I keep trying to
  read and failing due to density. I should really find a week away from civilization
  to just plonk down and meditate upon this.

##### Open questions for which I want answers

I want better references to being able to _regenerate_ the inequalities
description from a given automata which accepts the presburger set automata.
This will allow one to smoothly switch between the _geometric_ description
and the _algebraic_ description. There are some operations that only work
well on the geometry (such as optimisation), and others that only work well on
the algebraic description (such as state-space minimisation). I have not found
any good results for this, only scattered fragments of partial results.
If nothing else, I would like some kind of intuition for _why this is hard_.

Having tried my stab at it, the general impression that I have is that the
space of automata is much larger than the things that can be encoded as
presburger sets. Indeed, it was shown that automata accept numbers which
are ultimately periodic.

-  first order logic + "arithmetic with +" + (_another operation I cannot recall_).
   I'm going to fill this in once I re-find the reference.

But yes, it's known that automata accept a language that's broader than just
first order logic + "arithmetic with +", which means it's hard to dis-entangle
the presburger gits from the non-presburger bits of the automata.


#### Prolog

I wanted to get a better understading of how prolog works under the hood, so I began
re-implementing the [WAM: warren abstract machine](http://wambook.sourceforge.net/).
It's really weird, this is the _only stable reference_ I can find to implementing
high-performance prolog interpreters. I don't really understand how to chase the
paper-trail in this space, I'd greatly appreciate references. My implementation
is at [`bollu/warren-cpp`](https://github.com/bollu/warren-cpp/). Unfortunately,
I had to give up due to a really hard-to-debug bug.

It's crazy to debug this abstract machine, since the internal representation gets
_super convoluted_ and hard to track, due to the kind of optimised encoding it
uses on the heap.

If anyone has a better/cleaner design for implementing good prologs, I'd love
to know.

Another fun paper I found in this space thanks to Edward Kmett was
[the Rete matching algorithm](http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-rete-matching-algorithm/184405218),
which allows one to declare many many pattern matches, which are then "fused"
together into an optimal matcher that tries to reuse work across failed
matchers.

#### General Relativity

This was on my "list of things I want to understand before I die", so I wound
up taking up an Independent Study in university, which basically means that
I study something on my own, and visit a professor once every couple weeks,
and am graded at the end of the term. For GR, I wound up referencing a wide
variety of sources, as well as a bunch of pure math diffgeo books. I've read
everything referenced to various levels. I feel I did take away the core
ideas of differential and Riemannian geometry. I'm much less sure I've grokked
general relativity, but I can at least read the equations and I know all the
terms, so that's something.

- [The theoretical minimum by Leonard Susskind](https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/general-relativity/2012/fall).
  The lectures are breezy in style, building up the minimal theory (and no proofs)
  for the math, and a bunch of lectures spent analysing the physics. While I wish
  it were a little more proof heavy, it was a really great reference to learn the
  basic theory! I definitely recommend following this and then reading other
  books to fill in the gaps.
- [Gravitation by Misner Thorne and Wheeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_(book))
  This is an imposing book. I first read through the entire thing (Well, the parts I thought I needed),
  to be able to get a vague sense of what they're going for. They're rigorous in
  a very curious way: It has a bunch of great _physics_ perspectives of looking
  at things, and that was invaluable to me. Their view of forms as "slot machines"
  is also fun. In general, I found myself repeatedly consulting this book for
  the "true physical" meaning of a thing, such as curvature, parallel transport,
  the equation of a geodesic, and whatnot.
- [Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces by do Carmo](http://www2.ing.unipi.it/griff/files/dC.pdf)
  This is the best book to intro differential geometry I found. It throws away
  all of the high powered definitions that "modern" treatments offer, and
  starts from the ground up, building up the theory in 2D and 3D. This is amazing,
  since it gives you small, computable examples for things like
  "the Jacobian represents how tangents on a surface are transformed locally".
- [Symplectic geometry & classical mechanics by Tobias Osborne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXGTevGJ01o&list=PLDfPUNusx1EoVnrQcCRishydtNBYU6A0c)
  This lecture series was great, since it re-did a lot of the math I'd seen
  in a more physicist style, especially around vector fields, flows, and
  Lie brackets. Unfortunately for me, I never even _got_ to the classical
  mechanics part by the time the semester ended. I began
  [taking down notes in my repo](https://github.com/bollu/notes/blob/master/diffgeo/main.pdf),
  which I plan to complete.
- [Introduction to Smooth manifolds: John Lee](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~lee/Books/ISM/)
  This was a very well written _mathematical_ introduction to differential geometry.
  So it gets to the physically important bits (metrics, covariant derivatives)
  far later, so I mostly used it as a reference for problems and more rigour.
- [Einstein's original paper introducing GR, translated](http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Einstein_GRelativity_1916.pdf)
  finally made it click as to _why_
  he wanted to use tensor equations: tensor equations of the form `T = 0` are
  invariant in _any coordinate system_, since on change of coordinates, `T`
  changes by a multiplicative factor! It's a small thing in hindsight, but it
  was nice to see it explicitly spelled out, since as I understand, no one
  among the physicists knew tensor calculus at the time, so he had to introduce
  all of it.

#### Discrete differential geometry

I can't recall how I ran across this: I think it was because I was trying to
get a better understanding of Cohomology, which led me to Google for
"computational differential geometry", that finally led me to Discrete
differential geometry.

It's a really nice collection of theories that show us how to discretize
differential geometry in low dimensions, leading to rich intuitions and
a myriad of applications for computer graphics.

- [The textbook by Kennan Crane on the topic](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/paper.pdf)
  which I read over the summer when I was stuck (more often than I'd like) in
  the Paris metro. The book is very accessible, and requires just some
  imagination to grok. Discretizing differential geometry leads to most things
  being linear algebra, which means one can calculate things on paper easily.
  That's such a blessing.
- [Geodesics in Heat](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6216)
  explores a really nice way to discover geodesics by simulating the heat
  equation for a short time. The intuition is that we should think of the heat
  equation as describing the evolution of particles that are performing random
  walks. Now, if we simulate this system for a short while and then look at the
  distribution, particles that reach a particular location on the graph 
  _must have taken the shortest path_, since any longer path would not have 
  allowed particles to reach there. Thus, the distribution of particles at 
  time `dt` does truly represent distances from a given point.  The paper
  explores this analogy to find accurate geodesics on complex computational
  grids. This is aided by the use of differential geometry, appropriately
  discretized.
- [The vector heat method](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09170.pdf)
  explores computing the parallel transport of a vector across a discrete
  manifold efficiently, borrowing techniques from the 'Geodesics in Heat'
  paper.
- [Another paper by Kennan Crane: Lie group integrators for animation and control of vehicles](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/LieGroupIntegrators/paper.pdf)
  This paper describes a general recipe to tailor-make integrators for a system
  of constraints, by directly integrating over the lie group of the
  configuration space.  This leads to much more stable integrators. I have some
  misguided hope that we can perhaps adapt these techniques to build better FRP
  (functional reactive programming) systems, but I need to meditate on this a
  lot more to say anything definitively.




#### Synthetic differential geometry

It was [Arnaud Spiwack](http://assert-false.net/arnaud/)
who pointed me to this. It's a nice axiomatic
system of differential geometry, where we can use physicist style proofs of
"taking stuff upto order `dx`", and having everything work upto mathematical
rigor.

The TL;DR is that we want to add a new number called `dx` into the reals,
such that `dx^2 = 0`. But if such a number did exist, then clearly `dx = 0`.
However, the punchline is that to prove that `dx^2 = 0 => dx = 0` requires
the use of contradiction!

So, if we banish the law of excluded middle (and therefore no longer use
proof by contradiction), we are able to postulate the existence of a new
element `dx`, which obeys `dx^2 = 0`. Using this, we can build up the
whole theory of differential geometry in a pleasing way, without having to
go through the horror that is real analysis. (I am being hyperbolic, but really,
real analytic proofs are not pleasant).

[I began formalizing this in Coq and got a formalism going: `bollu/diffgeo`](https://www.github.com/bollu/diffgeo).

Once I was done with that, I realised I don't know how to exhibit _models_ of
the damn thing! So, reading up on that made me realise that I need around 8
chapters worth of a grad level textbook (the aptly named
[Models of Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4143-8)).

I was disheartened, so I [asked on `MathOverflow`](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/346385/constructing-computable-synthetic-differential-geometry)
(also my first ever question there), where I learnt about tangent categories and
differential lambda calculus. Unfortunately, I don't have the bandwidth to read
another 150-page tome, so this has languished.


### Optimisation on Manifolds

I began reading
[Absil: Optimisation on matrix manifolds](http://www.eeci-institute.eu/GSC2011/Photos-EECI/EECI-GSC-2011-M5/book_AMS.pdf)
which describes how to perform optimisation / gradient descent on
_arbitrary Riemannian manifolds_, as well as closed forms for well-known
manifolds. The exposition in this book is really good, since it picks a
concrete manifold and churns out all the basic properties of it manually. The
only problem I had with the books was that there were quite a few gaps (?) in
the proofs -- perhaps I missed a bunch.

This led me to learn Lie theory to some degree, since that was the natural
setting for many of the proofs. I finally saw _why_ anyone gives a shit about
the tangent space at the identity: because it's _easier to compute!_ For a
flavour of this, 
[consider this question on `math.se` by me that asks about computing tangent spaces of $O(n)$](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3389983/explicit-description-of-tangent-spaces-of-on).

#### AIRCS workshop

I attended the
[AI risk for computer scientists](https://intelligence.org/ai-risk-for-computer-scientists/)
workshop hosted by
[MIRI (Machine intelligence research institute)](https://intelligence.org/) in
December. Here, a bunch of people were housed at a bed & breakfast for a
week, and we discussed AI risk, why it's potentially the most important thing
to work on, and anything our hearts desired, really. I came away with new
branches of math I wanted to read, a better appreciation of the AI risk
community and a sense of what their "risk timelines" were, and some
explanations about sheaves and number theory that I was sorely lacking. All in
all, it was a great time, and I'd love to go back.

#### P-adic numbers

While I was on a particularly rough flight back from the USA to India when
coming back from the AIRCS workshop, I began to read the textbook
[Introduction to p-adic numbers by Fernando Gouvea](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540629115),
which fascinated me, so I then
[wrote up the cool parts introduced in the first two chapters as a blog post](http://bollu.github.io/#a-motivation-for-p-adic-analysis).
I wish to learn more about the p-adics and p-adic analysis, since they
seem to be deep objects in number theory.

In particular, a question that I thought might have a somewhat trivial answer
([why do the p-adics use base p in defining norm](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3482489/why-does-the-p-adic-norm-use-base-p))
turned out to have answers that were quite deep, which was something
unexpected and joyful!

#### Topology of functional programs

- [Slides by Martın Escardo](http://cs.ioc.ee/ewscs/2012/escardo/slides.pdf)
- [Synthetic topology of data types and classical spaces](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272990/1-s2.0-S1571066104X00177/1-s2.0-S1571066104051357/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEJP%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIGQAb828p1io4csznEej60j0PwJteuXf7OoHLSCDhkUTAiEA9ITs1JrUEOE%2Ft%2Fl5TI9ZkNLUfBIx42IZ%2FoAqQpdX4twq2AII6%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDBQOxJ3s3HCbVxSheCqsAt65yorZMMtIhLF7ML5sJQ9S5wZxBayKDrRkUKOjSzXxtQWebXs70FXhhpToXKvJoDrLgsqDzdF%2FAshZY%2FkDUep6KILxKnYxCBrBINhjFqxDlRZH0s1Y991RgCyNNnwmFI%2BrH70lSrV0OxQ9Z5WdXXPDkTLXv8512Xz%2BJn5DqEqdqD49FLbOuHl6PRM0TnYyNJkLBXNVwt75kkGkaTfdgmgiqh7YpcXcHlbqI2oqNcaxFDewXwKDCC7qWD6ECclLgszoeOXOtRI91nvNac8%2BLV4bXkKLXpd99H94N2vXPUPz99p6oqfdY9ixtcfI9POFX8agUilYjXKVhAWk4FSzzzMqbtZLBfkCZT4ffDTxRgL52yD%2FmL5E0Pe4mczVlUoB5DKoB8Lkitrt0BumQzDr4ffvBTrQAjVRuzG5V0CC%2Fd1t%2BUMPkrywaYytbrXCZ%2BkDo0xDBqsljY8DaGIiFINr8BEEpT7UX42GRhcDzpnOnztdAOTea3qZ3SmXJwgEoh0aiz%2B87MmsC57s0Q%2F%2B%2FDDvHBY3zLCrz7rdewXOgk6VxI9d5mhG3Du1dwPRbgOe798S2waDCD8LQA3rw7w5wNGa9Uv3xtNVH%2BHw%2FXcQ6OiubO4GL9mK8U5g7TVPh1hLB26XBQooKJ564VGf4J9VqWxjlx3NicVhqnFlGevNJNKyVLiyRsRCyQGMV59%2BXqUwdEMQZYWLbfUwELNz1NKfWumvu9BXC5jjsJgNx%2FRERSb7hqT1svMJU91o%2FHtatGAnPvVjYaNthha9O9jm%2BG9nw1vMsdyJ0asI5w5SrlsEyb5C7Vk7aLBcHAEi3XPRhivY1Q4hZAN0xY9VfEZrF%2FoM9HCGxr5cYs%2BP9w%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20191221T113658Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY6QRXTPOC%2F20191221%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=8a26656e8f8c8772afdc2ae6caa9b583fd59a8ee6303d9770d25b4a3d8a6291f&hash=42518d3e5cc1e77ed961c359d0ea8f59bd582d1e5f13d69c3eeb2563a6c82abd&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1571066104051357&tid=spdf-584e8188-4806-44bb-a118-9b63a53caaff&sid=f53691052392834d3e18a62484e2909639a9gxrqb&type=client)

Both of these describe a general method to transfer all topological ideas as
statements about _computability_ in a way that's far more natural (at least for
me, as a computer scientist). The notion of what a continuous function "should
be" (keeping inverse images of open sets open) arises naturally from this
computational viewpoint, and many proofs of topology amount to finding
functional programs that fit a certain type. It's a great read, and I feel gave
me a much better sense of what topology is trying to do.

- [I've written some exposition on this topic](http://bollu.github.io/#topology-is-really-about-computation--part-1),
  which maybe a more accessible read than the links above, since it tries to
  distill the fundamental idea into a blog post.

#### Philosophy

I've wanted to understand philosophy as a whole for a while now, at least
enough to get a general sense of what happened in each century. The last year,
I meandered through some philosophy of science, which led me to some really
wild ideas (such as that of
[Paul Feyerabend's 'science as an anarchic enterprise'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological_anarchism)
which I really enjoyed).

I also seem to get a lot more out of audio and video than text in general, so
I've been looking for podcasts and video lectures. I've been following:

- [The history of philosophy without any gaps](https://historyofphilosophy.net/)
  for a detailed exposition on, say, the greeks, or the arabic philosophers.
  Unfortunately, this podcast focuses on far too much detail for me to have been
  able to use it as a way to get a broad idea about _philosophy_ in itself.

- [Philosophize This! by Stephen West](http://philosophizethis.org/)
  Is a good philosophy podcast for a _broad_ overview of different areas
  of Philosophy. I got a lot out of this, since I was able to get a sense
  of the progression of ideas in (Western) Philosophy. So I now know what
  [Phenomenology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/) is,
  or what Foucault was reacting against.


I also attempted to read a bunch of philosophers, but the only ones I could
make a good dent on were the ones listed below. I struggled in writing this
section, since it's much harder to sanity check my understanding of philosophy,
versus mathematics, since there seems to be a range of interpretations of the
same philosophical work, and the general imprecise nature of language doesn't
help here at all. So please take all the descriptions below with some salt
to taste.

- [Discipline and Punish by Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish)
  Here, Foucault traces the history of the criminal justice system of society,
  and how it began as something performed 'on the body' (punishment),
  which was then expanded to a control 'of the mind' (reform). As usual,
  the perspective is fun, and I'm still going through the book.

- [Madness and Civilization by Michel Foucault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_and_Civilization)
  which attempts to chronicle how our view of madness evolved as society did.
  It describes how madmen, who were on the edges of society, but still
  "respected" (for exmaple, considered as 'being touched by the gods') were
  pathologized by the Renaissance, and were seen as requiring treatment. I'm
  still reading it, but it's enjoyable so far, as a new perspective for me.


- [The value of science by Henri Poincare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Value_of_Science).
  Here, he defends the importance of experimentation, as well as the value of
  intuition to mathematics, along with the importance of what we consider
  formal logic. It's a tough read sometimes, but I think I got something out of
  it, at least in terms of perspective about science and mathematics.

#### Information theory

I've been on a quest to understand information theory far better than I
currently do. In general, I feel like this might be a much better way to
internalize probability theory, since it feels like it states probabilistic
objects in terms of "couting" / "optimisation of encodings", which is a
perspective I find far more natural.

Towards this aim, I wound up reading:

- [Information theory, Learning, and inference algorithms](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html)
  This book attempts to provide the holistic view I was hoping for. It has
  great illustrations of the basic objects of information theory. However,
  I was hoping that the three topics would be more "unified" in the book,
  rather than being presented as three separate sections with some amount
  of back-and-forth-referencing among them. Even so, it was a really fun read.

- [Elements of information theory](http://www.cs-114.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Elements_of_Information_Theory_Elements.pdf)

#### Building intuition for Sheaves, Topoi, Logic

I don't understand the trifecta of sheaves, topoi, geometry, and logic, and
I'm trying to attack this knot from multiple sides at once.

- [Understanding networks and their behaviours using sheaf theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.4621)
- [Sheaves, objects, and distributed systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1571066108005264)
- [Sheaves are the canonical data strucure for sensor integration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.01446.pdf)
- [Elementary applied topology, Chapter 9: Sheaves](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/EAT/EATchapter9.pdf)
- [Sheaf theory: The mathematics of data fusion (video) (link to HackerNews)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13677308)

All of these provide geometric viewpoints of what sheaves are, in low-dimensional
examples of graphs which are easy to visualize. I'm also trudging through the
tome:

- [Sheaves in geometry and logic: A first introduction to Topos theory](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387977102)

which appears to follow the "correct path" of the algebraic geometers, but this
requires a lot of bandwidth.

- [The Rising Sea: foundations of algebraic geometry by Ravi Vakil](http://math.stanford.edu/~vakil/216blog/FOAGnov1817public.pdf)

This is a hardcore algebraic geometry textbook, and is arguably
_great for studying sheaves_ because of it. Sheaves are Chapter 2, and allows
one to see them be developed in their "true setting" as it were. In that
Grothendeick first invented sheaves for algebraic geometry, so it's good to
see them in the home they were born in. Once again, this is a book I lack
bandwidth for except to breezily read it as I go to bed. I did get something
out from doing this. I'm considering taking this book up as an independent
study, say the first four chapters. I'll need someone who knows algebraic
geometry to supervise me, though, which is hard to find in an institute geared
purely for computer science. (If anyone on the internet is kind enough to
volunteer some of their time to answer questions, I'll be very glad! Please
email me at `rot13(fvqqh.qehvq@tznvy.pbz)`)

#### The attic

This section contains random assortments that I don't recall how I stumbled
across, but too cool to not include on the list. I usually read these in bits
and pieces, or as bedtime reading right before I go to bed to skim.  I find
that skimming such things gives me access to knowing about tools I would not
have known otherwise. I like knowing the existence of things, even if I don't
recall the exact thing, since knowing that something like `X` exists has saved me
from having to reinvent `X` from scratch.

- [Group Theory: Birdtracks, Lie's and Exceptional Groups by Predrag Cvitanovic](http://www.cns.gatech.edu/GroupTheory/version9.0/GroupTheory.pdf)
  is an exposition of Lie theory using some notation called as "Birdtrack notation",
  which is supposedly a very clean way of computing invariants, inspired by
  Feynmann notation. The writing style is informal and pleasant, and I decided
  to save the book purely because the first chapter begins with
  "Basic Concepts: A typical quantum theory is constructed from a few building blocks...".
  If a book considers building quantum theories as its starting point, I really
  want to see where it goes.

- [Elementary Applied topology by Robert M Ghirst](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/notes.html)
  I wouldn't classify the book as elementary because it skims over too much to be
  useful as a reference, but it's great to gain an intuition for what, say,
  homology or cohomology is. I am currently reading the section on Sheaf theory,
  and I'm getting a lot out of it, since it describes how to write down, say,
  min-cut-max-flow or niquist-shannon in terms of sheaves. I don't grok it yet,
  but even knowing this can be done is very nice. The book is a wonderful
  walkthrough in general.


- [On polysemous mathematical illustration by Robert M Ghirst](https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/?play=2034)
  This is a talk on the wonderful illustrations by the above author, about
  the different types of mathematical illustrations one can have, and different
  "levels of abstraction".

- [Mathematical Impressions: The illustrations of AT Femenko](http://chronologia.org/en/math_impressions/poster016.html)
  These are _beautiful_ illustrated pictures of various concepts in math, which
  tend to _evoke_ the feeling of the object, without being too direct about it.
  For example, consider "gradient descent" below. I highly recommend going
  through the full gallery.


- [Gradient Descent](http://chronologia.org/art/math/123a176.jpg)
  <img width=200 height=200 src="http://chronologia.org/art/math/123a176.jpg">

- [Topological Zoo](http://chronologia.org/art/math/077a011.jpg)
  <img width=200 height=200 src="http://chronologia.org/art/math/077a011.jpg">

- [Persistent Homology in Multivariate Data Visualization](https://bastian.rieck.me/research/Dissertation_Rieck_2017.pdf)
  This is the PhD dissertation of [Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me/),
  who's now a postdoc at ETH. I deeply enjoyed reading it, since it pays
  a lot of attention to the _design_ of analyses, and how to interpret
  topological data. I really enjoyed getting a good sense of how one can
  use persistent homology to understand data, and the trade-offs between
  [Vietoris-Rips complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex)
  and the [Cech complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cech_complex).

- [An introduction to Geometric algebra](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1205.5935.pdf)
  I fell in love with geometric algebra, since it provides a really clean way
  to talk about _all possible subspaces_ of a given vector space. This provides
  super slick solutions to many geometry and linear algebra problems. The
  way I tend to look at it is that when one does linear algebra, there's a strict
  separation between "vectors" (which are elements of the vector space), and,
  say, "hyperplanes" (which are _subspaces_ of the vector space), as well as
  objects such as "rotations" (which are _operators_ on the vector space).
  Geometric algebra provides a rich enough _instruction set_ to throw all
  these three distinct things into a blender. This gives a really concise
  language to describe all phenomena that occurs in the vector space world ---
  which, let's be honest, is _most_ tractable phenomena! I had a blast
  reading about GA and the kinds of operators it provides.

- [Circuits via Topoi](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07159). This paper attempts
  to provide an introduction to topos theory by providing a semantics for
  both combinational and sequential circuits under a unifying framework. I keep
  coming back to this article as I read more topos theory. Unfortunately, I'm
  not "there yet" in my understanding of topoi. I hope to be next year!


- [Fearless Symmetry](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691138718/fearless-symmetry)
  This is definitely my favourite non-fiction book that I've read in 2019, hands
  down. The book gives a great account of the mathematical objects that went
  into Wiles' book of Fermat's last theorem. It starts with things like
  "what is a permutation" and ends at questions like "what's a reciprocity law"
  or "what's the absolute galois group". While at points, I do believe the book
  goes far too rapidly, all in all, it's a solid account of number theory
  that's distilled, but not in any way diluted. I really recommend reading this
  book if you have any interest in number theory (or, like me, a passing
  distaste due to a course on elementary number theory I took, with proofs that
  looked very unmotivated). This book made me decide that I should, indeed,
  definitely learn algebraic number theory, upto at least
  [Artin Reciprocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artin_reciprocity_law).


- [Rememberance of Earth's past trilogy by Liu Cixin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past)
  While I would not classify this as "mind-blowing" (which I do classify Greg
  Egan books as), they were still a solidly fun read into how humanity would
  evolve and interact with alien races. It also poses some standard solutions
  to the Fermi Paradox, but it's done well. I felt that the fact that it was
  translated was painfully obvious in certain parts of the translation, which
  I found quite unfortunate. However, I think book 3 makes up in grandeur for
  whatever was lost in translation.

- [Walkaway by Cory Doctorow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkaway_(Doctorow_novel))
  The book is set in a dystopian nightmare, where people are attempting to
  "walk away" from society and set up communes, where they espouse having
  a post-scarcity style economy based on gifting. It was a really great
  description of what such a society could look like. I took issue with some
  weird love-triangle-like-shenanigans in the second half of the book, but
  the story arc more than makes up for it. Plus, the people throw a party
  called as a "communist party" in the first page of the book, which grabbed
  my attention immediately!

- [PURRS: Parma University Recurrence Relation Solver](http://www.cs.unipr.it/purrs/)
  I wanted better tactics for solving recurrences in Coq, which led me into
  a rabbit hole of the technology of recurrence relation solving. This was the
  newest _stable_ reference to a complete tool that I was able to find. Their
  references section is invaluable, since it's been vetted by them
  actually implementing this tool!

- [Term rewriting and all that](https://www21.in.tum.de/~nipkow/TRaAT/).
  I read this book purely for its description of Groebner bases and the Bucchberger
  algorithm in a way that _made sense_ for the first time.
  [I've written about this more extensively before](http://bollu.github.io/#what-the-hell-is-a-grobner-basis-ideals-as-rewrite-systems)
  so I'm not going to repeat myself here. In general, I think it's a great book
  that's worth reading, if nothing else, for at least the chapter on Groebner
  bases.

- [Lucid: The dataflow programming language](http://worrydream.com/refs/Wadge%20-%20Lucid,%20the%20Dataflow%20Programming%20Language.pdf)
  This document is the user manual of Lucid. I didn't fully understand the
  book, but what I understood as their main argument is that full access too
  looping is un-necessary to perform most of the tasks that we do. Rather,
  one can provide a "rich enough" set of combinators to manipulate streams
  that allows one to write all programs worthy of our interest.

- [Bundle Adjustment — A Modern Synthesis](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00548290/document)
  I learnt about Bundle Adjustment from a friend taking a course on robotics.
  The general problem is to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of a point cloud
  given 2D projections of the points and the camera parameters, as the camera
  moves in time. I found the paper interesting since it winds up invoking a
  decent amount of differential geometric and gauge theoretic language to
  describe the problem at hand. I was unable to see why this vocabulary helped
  in this use-case, but perhaps I missed the point of the paper. It was hard to
  tell.

#### Conclusions

I always feel a little wrong posting this at the end of every year, since I
feel that among the things I cover under "read", I've internalized some things
far better than others: For example, I feel I understannd Riemannian geometry
far better than I do General Relativity. I try to put up the caveats at the
beginning of each section, but I'd really like a way to communicate my
confidence without reducing readability.


The final thing that I wish for is some kind of reading group? It's hard
to maintain a group when my interests shift as rapidly as they do, which
was one of the reason I really loved the AIRCS workshop: They were people
who were working on formal methods, compilers, type theory, number theory,
embedded systems, temporal logic... It was very cool to be in a group of
people who had answers and intuitions to questions that had bugged me for
some time now. I wonder if attending courses at a larger research university
feels the same way. My uni is good, but we have quite small population, which
almost by construction means reduced diversity.

I also wish that I could openly add more references to repos I've been working
on for a while now, but I can't due to the nature of academia and publishing.
This one bums me out, since there's a long story of a huge number of commits
and trial-by-fire that I think I'll be too exhausted to write about once the
thing is done.

Sometimes, I also wish that I could spend the time I spend reading _disparate_
topics on _focused reading on one topic_. Unfortunately, I feel like I'm not
wired this way, and the joy I get from sampling many things at the same time
and making connections is somehow much deeper than the joy I get by deeply
reading one topic (in exclusion of all else). I don't know what this says
about my chances as a grad student in the future `:)`.


## [A motivation for p-adic analysis](#a-motivation-for-p-adic-analysis)

I've seen the definitions of p-adic numbers scattered around on the internet,
but this analogy as motivated by the book
[p-adic numbers by Fernando Gouvea](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540629115)
really made me understand why one would study the p-adics, and why the
definitions are natural. So I'm going to recapitulate the material, with the
aim of having somoene who reads this post be left with a sense of why it's
profitable to study the p-adics, and what sorts of analogies are fruitful when
thinking about them.

We wish to draw an analogy between the ring $\mathbb C[X]$, where $(X - \alpha)$
are the prime ideals, and $\mathbb Z$ where $(p)$ are the prime ideals. We wish
to take all operations one can perform with polynomials, such as generating
functions ($1/(X - \alpha) = 1 + X + X^2 + \dots$ ),
taylor expansions (expanding aronund $(X - \alpha)$),
and see what their analogous objects will look like in $\mathbb Z$
relative to a prime $p$.

#### Perspective: Taylor series as writing in base $p$:

Now, for example, given a prime $p$, we can write any positive integer $m$
in base $p$, as $(m = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i p^i)$ where $(0 \leq a_i \leq p - 1)$.

For example, consider $m = 72, p = 3$. The expansion of 72 is
$72 = 0\times 1 + 0 \times 3 + 2 \times 3^2 + 2 \times 3^3$.
This shows us that 72 is divisible by $3^2$.

This perspective to take is that this us the information local to prime $p$,
about what order the number $m$ is divisible by $p$,
just as the taylor expansion tells us around $(X - \alpha)$ of a polynomial $P(X)$
tells us to what order $P(X)$ vanishes at a point $\alpha$.

#### Perspective: rational numbers and rational functions as infinite series:

Now, we investigate the behaviour of expressions such as
- $P(X) = 1/(1+X) = 1 - X + X^2 -X^3 + \dots$.

We know that the above formula is correct formally from the theory of
generating functions.  Hence, we take inspiration to define values for
_rational numbers_.

Let's take $p \equiv 3$, and we know that $4 = 1 + 3 = 1 + p$.

We now calculate $1/4$ as:

$$
1/4 = 1/(1+p) = 1 - p + p^2 - p^3 + p^4 - p^5 + p^6 + \cdots
$$

However, we don't really know how to interpret $(-1 \cdot p)$, since we assumed
the coefficients are always non-negative. What we can do is to rewrite $p^2 = 3p$,
and then use this to make the coefficient positive. Performing this transformation
for every negative coefficient, we arrive at:


$$
\begin{align*}
1/4 &= 1/(1+p) = 1 - p + p^2 - p^3 + p^4 + \cdots \\
&= 1 + (- p + 3p) + (- p^3 + 3p^3)  +  \cdots \\
&= 1 + 2p + 2p^3 + \cdots
\end{align*}
$$

We can verify that this is indeed correct, by multiplying with $4 = (1 + p)$
and checking that the result is $1$:

$$
\begin{align*}
&(1 + p)(1 + 2p + 2p^3 + \cdots) \\
&= (1 + p) + (2p + 2p^2) + (2p^3 + 2p^4) + \cdots \\
&= 1 + 3p + 2p^2 + 2p^3 + 2p^4 + \cdots \\
&\text{(Rewrite $3p = p \cdot p = p^2$)} \\
&= 1 + (p^2 + 2p^2) + 2p^3 + 2p^4 + \cdots \\
&= 1 + 3p^2 + 2p^3 + 2p^4 + \cdots \\
&\text{(Rewrite $3p^2 = p^3$ and collect $p^3$)} \\
&= 1 + 3p^3 + 2p^4 + \cdots \\
&= 1 + 3p^4 + \cdots \\
&= 1 + \cdots = 1
\end{align*}
$$

What winds up happening is that all the numbers after $1$ end up being cleared
due to the carrying of $(3p^i \mapsto p^{i+1})$.

This little calculation indicates that we can also define take the $p$-adic
expansion of _rational numbers_.

#### Perspective: -1 as a p-adic number

We next want to find a p-adic expansion of -1, since we can then expand
out theory to work out "in general". The core idea is to "borrow" $p$, so
that we can write -1 as $(p - 1) - p$, and then we fix $-p$, just like we fixed
$-1$. This eventually leads us to an infinite series expansion for $-1$. Written
down formally, the calculation proceeds as:

$$
\begin{align*}
-1 &= -1 + p - p  \qquad \text{(borrow $p$, and subtract to keep equality)} \\
&= (p - 1) - p \qquad \text{(Now we have a problem of $-p$)} \\
&= (p - 1) - p + p^2 - p^2  \\
&= (p - 1) + p(p - 1) - p^2 \\
&= (p - 1) + p(p - 1) - p^2 + p^3 - p^3 \\
&= (p - 1) + p(p - 1) + p^2(p - 1) - p^3 \\
&\text{(Generalizing the above pattern)} \\
-1 &= (p - 1) + p(p - 1) + p^2(p - 1) + p^3(p - 1) + p^4(p - 1) + \cdots \\
\end{align*}
$$

This now gives us access to negative numbers, since we can formally multiply
the series of two numbers, to write $-a = -1 \cdot a$.


Notice that this definition of $-1$ also curiously matches the 2s complement
definition, where we have $-1 = 11\dots 1$. In this case, the expansion is
_infinite_, while in the 2s complement case, it is finite. I would be very
interested to explore this connection more fully.

#### What have we achieved so far?

We've now managed to completely reinterpret all the numbers we care about in
the rationals as power series in base $p$. This is pretty neat. We're next
going to try to _complete_ this, just as we complete the rationals to get
the reals. We're going to show that we get a _different_ number system on
completion, called $\mathbb Q_p$.

To perform this, we first look at how the $p$-adic numbers help us solve
congruences mod p, and how this gives rise to completions to equations such
as $x^2 - 2 = 0$, which in the reals give us $x = \sqrt 2$, and in $\mathbb Q_p$
give us a different answer!

#### Solving $X^2 \equiv 25 \mod 3^n$

Let's start by solving an equation we already know how to solve:
$X^2 \equiv 25 \mod 3^n$.

We already know the solutions to $X^2 \equiv 25 \mod 3^n$ in $\mathbb Z$ are
$X \equiv \pm 5 \mod 3^n$.

Explicitly, the solutions are:
- $X \equiv 3 \mod 3$
- $X \equiv 5 \mod 9$
- $X \equiv 5 \mod 27$
- At this point, the answer remains constant.

This was somewhat predictable. We move to a slightly more interesting case.

#### Solving $X = -5 \mod 3^n$

The solution sets are:
- $X \equiv -5 \equiv 1 \mod 3$
- $X \equiv -5 \equiv 4 = 1 + 3 \mod 9$
- $X \equiv -5 \equiv 22 = 1 + 3 + 2 \cdot 9 \mod 27$
- $X \equiv -5 \equiv 76 = 1 + 3 + 2 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 27 \mod 81$



This gives us the infinite 3-adic expansion:

- $X = -5 = 1 + 1\cdot 3 + 2\cdot 3^2 + 2\cdot 3^3 + \dots$

Note that we can't really _predict_ the digits in the 3-adic sequence of -5,
but we can keep expanding and finding more digits.

Also see that the solutions are "coherent". In that, if we look at the
solution mod 9, which is $4$, and then consider it mod 3, we get $1$. So,
we can say that given a sequence of integers $0 \leq \alpha_n \leq p^n - 1$,
**$\alpha_n$ is p-adically coherent sequence** iff:

- $ \alpha_{n+1} = \alpha_n \mod p^n$.


#### Viewpoint: Solution sets of $X^2 = 25 \mod 3^n$

Since our solution sets are coherent, we can view the solutions as a tree,
with the expansions of $X = 5, X = -5 \mod 3$ and then continuing onwards
from there. That is, the sequences are

- $2 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow \dots$
- $1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 22 \rightarrow 76 \rightarrow \dots$

#### Solving $X^2 \equiv 2 \mod 7^n$

We now construct a solution to the equation $X^2 = 1$ in the 7-adic system,
thereby showing that $\mathbb Q_p$ is indeed strictly _larger_ than $\mathbb Q$,
since this equation does not have rational roots.

For $n=1$, we have the solutions as $X \equiv 3 \mod 7$, $X \equiv 4 \equiv -3 \mod 7$.

To find solutions for $n = 2$, we recall that we need our solutions to be consistent
with those for $n = 1$. So, we solve for:
- $(3 + 7k)^2 = 2 \mod 49$, $(4 + 7k)^2 = 2 \mod 49$.

Solving the first of these:

$$
\begin{align*}
(3 + 7k)^2 &\equiv 2 \mod 49 \\
9 + 42 k + 49k^2 &\equiv 2 \mod 49 \\
9 + 42 k + 0k^2 &\equiv 2 \mod 49 \\
7 + 42 k &\equiv 0 \mod 49 \\
1 + 6 k &\equiv 0 \mod 49 \\
k &\equiv 1 \mod 7
\end{align*}
$$

This gives the solution $X \equiv 10 \mod 49$. The other branch ($X = 4 + 7k$)
gives us $X \equiv 39 \equiv -10 \mod 49$.

We can continue this process indefinitely (_exercise_), giving us the sequences:

- $3 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 108 \rightarrow 2166 \rightarrow \dots$
- $4 \rightarrow 39 \rightarrow 235 \rightarrow 235 \rightarrow \dots$

We can show that the sequences of solutions we get satisfy the equation
$X^2 = 2 \mod 7$. This is so by construction. Hence, $\mathbb Q_7$ contains
a solution that $\mathbb Q$ does not, and is therefore strictly bigger, since
we can already represent every rational in $\mathbb Q$ in $\mathbb Q_7$.


#### Use case: Solving $X = 1 + 3X$ as a recurrence

Let's use the tools we have built so far to solve the equation $X = 1 + 3X$.
Instead of solving it using algebra, we look at it as a recurrence $X_{n+1} = 1 + 3X_n$.
This gives us the terms:
- $X_0 = 1$
- $X_1 = 1 + 3$
- $X_2 = 1 + 3 + 3^2$
- $X_n = 1 + 3 + \dots + 3^n$

In $\mathbb R$, this is a divergent sequence. However, we know that the
solution so $1 + X + X^2 + \dots = 1/(1-X)$, at least as a generating function.
Plugging this in, we get that the answer should be:

- $1/(1 - 3) = -1/2$

which is indeed the correct answer.

Now this required some really shady stuff in $\mathbb R$. However, with a change
of viewpoint, we can explain what's going on. We can look at the above series
as being a series in $\mathbb Q_3$.  Now, this series does _really_ converge,
and by the same argument as above, it converges to $-1/2$.

The nice thing about this is that a dubious computation becomes a legal one
by changing one's perspective on where the above series lives.

#### Viewpoint: 'Evaluation' for p-adics

The last thing that we need to import from the theory of polynomials
is the ability to _evaluate_ them: Given a rational function $F(X) = P(X)/Q(X)$,
where $P(X), Q(X)$ are polynomials, we can
evaluate it at some arbitrary point $x_0$, as long as $x_0$ is not a zero
of the polynomial $Q(X)$.

We would like a similar function, such that for a fixed prime $p$, we obtain
a ring homomorphism from $\mathbb Q \rightarrow \mathbb F_p^x$, which we will
denote as $p(x_0)$, where we are imagining that we are "evaluating" the prime
$p$ against the rational $x_0$.

We define the value of $x_0 = a/b$ at the prime $p$ to be equal to
$ab^{-1} \mod p$, where $b b^{-1} \equiv 1 \mod p$. That is, we compute the
usual $ab^{-1}$ to evaluate $a/b$, except we do this $(\mod p)$, to stay with
the analogy.

Note that if $b \equiv 0 \mod p$, then we cannot evaluate
the rational $a/b$, and we say that $a/b$ has a pole at $p$. The order
of the pole is the number of times $p$ occurs in the prime factorization of $b$.

I'm not sure how profitable this viewpoint is, so I
[asked on math.se](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3483369/profit-of-definition-evaluation-of-a-rational-at-a-p-adic),
and I'll update this post when I recieve a good answer.


#### Perspective: Forcing the formal sum to converge by imposing a new norm:

So far, we have dealt with infinite series in base $p$, which have terms
$p^i, i \geq 0$.
Clearly, these sums are divergent as per the usual topology on $\mathbb Q$.
However, we would enjoy assigning analytic meaning to these series. Hence, we
wish to consider a new notion of the absolute value of a number, which makes it
such that $p^i$ with large $i$ are considered small.


We define the absolute value for a field $K$ as a function
$|\cdot |: K \rightarrow \mathbb R$. It obeys the axioms:


1. $\lvert x \rvert = 0 \iff x = 0$
2. $\lvert xy \rvert =  \lvert x \rvert  \lvert y \rvert$ for all $x, y \in K$
3. $\lvert x + y \rvert \leq \lvert x \rvert + \lvert y \rvert$, for all $x, y \in K$.


We want the triangle inequality so it's metric-like, and the norm to be
multiplicative so it measures the size of elements.

The usual absolute value $\lvert x \rvert \equiv \\{ x : x \geq 0; -x : ~ \text{otherwise} \\}$ satisfies
these axioms.

Now, we create a new absolute value that measures primeness. We first introduce
a gadget known as a valuation, which measures the $p$-ness of a number. We use
this to create a norm that makes number smaller as their $p$-ness increases.
This will allow infinite series in $p^i$ to converge.

#### p-adic valuation: Definition

First, we introduce
a valuation $v_p: \mathbb Z - \\{0\\} \rightarrow \mathbb R$, where $v_p(n)$ is
the power of the prime $p^i$ in the prime factorization of $n$. More formally,
$v_p(n)$ is the unique number such that:

- $n = p^{v_p(n)} m$, where $p \nmid m$.
- We extend the valuation to the rationals by defining $v_p(a/b) = v_p(a) - v_p(b)$.
- We set $v_p(0) = +\infty$. The intuition is that $0$ can be divided by $p$
  an infinite number of times.

The valuation gets larger as we have larger powers of $p$ in the prime
factorization of a number. However, we want the norm to get _smaller_. Also,
we need the norm to be multiplicative, while $v_p(nm) = v_p(n) + v_p(m)$, which
is additive.


To fix both of these, we create a norm by exponentiating $v_p$.
This converts the additive property into a multiplicative property. We
exponentiate with a negative sign so that higher values of $v_p$ lead to
smaller values of the norm.

#### p-adic abosolute value: Definition

Now, we define the **p-adic absolute value** of a number $n$ as
$|n|_p \equiv p^{-v_p(n)}$.

- the norm of $0$ is $p^{-v_p(0)} = p^{-\infty} = 0$.
- If $p^{-v_p(n)} = 0$, then $-v_p(n) = \log_p 0 = -\infty$, and hence $n = 0$.
- The norm is multiplicative since $v_p$ is additive.
- Since $v_p(x + y) \geq \min (v_p(x), v_p(y)), |x + y|_p \leq max(|x|_p, |y|_p) \leq |x|_p + |y|_p$.
  Hence, the triangle inequality is also satisfied.

So $|n|_p$ is indeed a norm, which measures $p$-ness, and is smaller as $i$
gets larger in the power $p^i$ of the factorization of $n$, causing our
infinite series to converge.

There is a question of why we chose a base $p$ for $|n|_p = p^{v_p(n)}$. It would
appear that any choice of $|n|_p = c^{v_p(n)}, c > 1$ would be legal.
[I asked this on `math.se`](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3482489/why-does-the-p-adic-norm-use-base-p),
and the answer is that this choosing a base $p$ gives us the nice formula

$$
\forall x \in \mathbb Z, \prod_{\{p : p~\text{is prime}\} \cup \{ \infty \}} |x|_p = 1
$$

That is, the product of all $p$ norms and the usual norm
(denoted by $\lvert x \rvert_\infty $ )
give us the number 1. The reason is that the $ \lvert x\rvert_p $ give us
multiples $p^{-v_p(x)}$,
while the usual norm $\lvert x \rvert_\infty$ contains a multiple
$p^{v_p(x)}$, thereby cancelling each other out.


#### Conclusion

What we've done in this whirlwind tour is to try and draw analogies between
the ring of polynomials $\mathbb C[X]$ and the ring $\mathbb Z$, by trying
to draw analogies between their prime ideals: $(X - \alpha)$ and $(p)$. So,
we imported the notions of generating functions, polynomial evaluation, and
completions (of $\mathbb Q$) to gain a picture of what $\mathbb Q_p$ is like.

We also tried out the theory we've built against some toy problems, that shows
us that this point of view maybe profitable. If you found this interesting,
I highly recommend the book
[p-adic numbers by Fernando Gouvea](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540629115).



## [Line of investigation to build physical intuition for semidirect products](#line-of-investigation-to-build-physical-intuition-for-semidirect-products)

To quote wikipedia:
> In crystallography, the space group of a crystal splits as the semidirect
> product of the point group and the translation group if and only if the space
> group is symmorphic

The if and only if is interesting: The geometry ofthe crystal lattice truly
appears to capture the structure of the semidirect product. It's a discrete
object as well, which makes it way easier to visualize. I'm going to hunt down
the definitions involved so I can finally feel like I truly understand semidirect
products from the "action" perspective.

## [Topology is really about computation --- part 2](#topology-is-really-about-computation--part-2)

Here, we're going to describe whatever I've picked up of sheaves in the past
couple of weeks. I'm trying to understand the relationship between sheaves,
topoi, geometry, and logic. I currently see how topoi allows us to model logic,
and how sheaves allow us to model geometry, but I see nothing about the
relationship! I'm hoping that writing this down will allow me to gain some
perspective on this.

## What is a sheaf?

Let's consider two sets $P, A$, $P \subseteq A$. Now, given a function
$f: A \rightarrow X$, we can restrict this function to $ A_P: P \rightarrow X $.
So, we get to _invert the direction_:

$$
(P \subseteq A) \iff (f: A \rightarrow X) \rightarrow (f_P: P \rightarrow X)
$$

We should now try to discover some sort of structure to this "reversal"
business. Perhaps we will discover a contravariant functor! (Spoiler: we will).


## [Topology is really about computation --- part 1](#topology-is-really-about-computation--part-1)

Most people believe that topology is about some notion of "nearness" or
"closeness", which has been abstracted out from our usual notion of
continuity that we have from a metric space. Here, I make the claim that
topology is really about _computation_, and more specifically, _decidability_.
These are not new ideas. I learnt of this from a monograph 
[The topology of computation](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272990/1-s2.0-S1571066104X00177/1-s2.0-S1571066104051357/main.pdf),
but this does not seem very well known, so I decided to write about it.

The idea is this: We have turing machines which can compute things. We then
also have a set $S$. Now, a topology $\tau \subset 2^S$ precisely encodes
which of the subsets of $S$ can be separated from the rest of the space by a turing machine.
Thus, a discrete space is a very nice space, where every point can be separated
from every other point. An indescrete space is one where no point can be separated.

Something like the reals is somewhere in between, where we can separate
stuff inside an open interval from stuff clearly outside, but there's some
funny behaviour that goes on at the boundary due to things like `(0.999... = 1)`,
which we'll see in detail in a moment.

#### Semidecidability

A subset $Q\subseteq S$ is _semidecidable_, if there exists a turing machine
$\hat Q: Q \rightarrow \{ \bot, \top \}$, such that:

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat Q(q) = \top \iff q \in Q \\
\hat Q(q) = \bot \iff q \notin Q \\
\end{align*}
$$

Where $\top$ signifies stopping at a state and returning `TRUE`, and
$\bot$ signifies _never halting at all_!. So, the subset $Q$ is
_semidedicable_, in that, we will halt and say `TRUE` if the element
belongs in the set. But if an element does not belong in the set, we are
supposed to never terminate.

#### Deep dive: semidecidability of the interval $(1, 2)$

Let's start with an example. We consider the interval $I = (1, 2)$, as a
subset of $\mathbb{R}$.Let the turing machine recieve the real number
as a function $f: \mathbb N \rightarrow \{0, 1, \dots 9\}$, such that
given a real number ${(a_0 \cdot a_1 \cdot a_2 \dots)}$, this is encoded as a
function ${f_a(i) = a_i}$.

We now build a turing machine $\hat I$ which when given the input the function $f_a$,
semi-decides whether ${a \in I}$.

Let's consider the numbers in $I$:

$$
0 \rightarrow \texttt{NO} \\
0.\overline{9} \rightarrow \texttt{NO} \\
1 \rightarrow \texttt{NO} \\
1.a_1 a_2 \dots \rightarrow \texttt{YES} \\
1.\overline{9} \rightarrow \texttt{NO} \\
2.0 \rightarrow \texttt{NO} \\
2.a_1 a_2 \rightarrow \texttt{NO}
$$

So, we can write a turing machine (ie, some code) that tries to decide whether
a real number $a$'s encoding $f_a$ belongs to the interval $I = (1, 2)$
as follows:

```py
def decide_number_in_open_1_2(f):
  # if the number is (1.abcd)
  if f(0) == 1:
    # (1.99...99x) | look for the x.
    # If the number is 1.999..., do not terminate.
    # if the number is any other number of the form 1.99..x, terminate
    i = 1
    while f(i) != 9: i += 1
    return
  # if the number is not 1.abcd, do not terminate
  while True: pass
```

Hence, we say that the interval $I = (1, 2)$ is _semi-decidable_, since we
have a function
$\hat I \equiv \texttt{decide-number-in-open-1-2}$
such that
$\hat I (f_a) \text{ terminates } \iff a \in I$.
We don't make _any claim_ about
what happens if $a \notin I$. This is the essence of semidecidability: We
can precisely state when elements in the set belong to the set, but not
when they don't.

### Semi decidability in general

To put this on more solid ground, we define a topology on a set $S$ by considering
programs which recieve as input elements of $S$, suitably encoded. For example,
the way in which we encoded real numbers as functions from the index to the
digit. Similarly, we encode other mathematical objects in some suitable way.

Now, we define:

- For every program $P$ which takes as inputs elements in $S$, the set
  ${halts(P) \equiv \\{ s \in S \vert P(s) \text{halts} \\}}$ is called as a
  _semidecidable set_.

- Alternatively, we can say for a subset ${T \subset S}$, if there
  exists a program ${\hat T}$, such that
  ${s \in T \iff \hat T(s) \text{ halts}}$, then $T$ is semi-dedecidable.

These are just two viewpoints on the same object. In one, we define the
set based on the program. In the other, we define the program based on the
set.

### Semi decidability of the empty set and the universe set.

The empty set is semi-decidable, due to the existence of the program:
```py
def semidecide_empty(x):
  while True: continue
```


The universe set is semi-decidable, due to the existence of the program:
```py
def semidecide_univ(x): return
```

### Semi decidability of the union of sets

infinite unions of sets are semi decidable, since we can "diagonalize" on
the steps of all programs. That way, if any program halts, we will reach
the state where it halts in our diagonalized enumeration.



Let `A00, A01... A0n` be the initial states of the machines. We are trying to
semidecide whether any of them halt. We lay out the steps of the machines
in an imaginary grid:

```
A00 A01 A02 ... A0n
A10 A11 A12 ... A1n
A20 A21 A22 ... A2n
Am0 Am1 Am2 ... Amn
```

For example, machine `A0` has states:

```
A00 -> A10 -> .. -> Am0
```
We can walk through the combined state-space of the machines as:

```
A00
A01 A10
A02 A11 A20
A03 A12 A21 A30
...
```

Where on the `k`'th line, we collect all states $A_{ij}$ such that $(i + j = k)$.

Now, if any of the machines have a state that is `HALT`, we will reach the
state as we enumerate the diagonals, and the machine that explores the
combined state space can also return `HALT`.

### Semi decidability of the intersection of sets

infinite intersections of sets are _not_ semi decidable, since by running
these programs in parallel, we cannot know if an infinite number of programs
halt in finite time. We _can_ tell if _one_ of them halts, but of if _all_
of them halt.

For example, consider the sequence of machines produced by `machine_creator`:

```py
## creates a machine that stops after n steps
def machine_creator(n):
    # f terminates after n steps
    def f(x):

We wish to check if the intersection of all `machine_creator(n)` halt, for all
$n \geq 0, n \in \mathbb N$. Clearly, the answer is an infinite number of steps,
even though every single machine created by `machine_creator` halts in a
finite number of steps.

## [Geometric characterization of normal subgroups](#geometric-characterization-of-normal-subgroups)
> $Stab(Orb(x)) = Stab(x) \iff Stab(x) \text{ is normal}$

> $\forall x' \in Orb(x), Stab(x') = Stab(x) \iff Stab(x) \text{ is normal}$


#### Forward: if the stabilizer is normal, then all elements in the orbit have the same stabilizer

Let a group $G$ act on a set $X$ with action $(~\dot~) : G \times X \rightarrow X$.
Let $H \subseteq G$ be the stabilizer of a point $x \in X$. Now, let
$K = kHk^{-1}$, a conjugacy class of $H$. Clearly, the element $(k \cdot x)$
in the orbit of $x$ is stabilized by $K$.

If the group $H$ is normal, then $K = H$. So every element in the orbit of $x$
is stabilized by $H$.

#### Interaction of stablizer and the orbit:

> $Stab(g \cdot x) = g Stab(x) g^{-1}$

> $g^{-1} Stab(g \cdot x) g = Stab(x)$

-  Proof of $s \in Stab(x) \implies gsg^{-1} \in Stab(g \cdot x)$:
   The action of $gsg^{-1}$ on $g \cdot x$ is:
   $(g \cdot x \rightarrow_{g^-1} x \rightarrow_s x \rightarrow_g g \cdot x)$.

- Proof of $s' \in Stab(g \cdot x) \implies g^{-1}s'g \in Stab(x)$:
  The action of $g^{-1}s'g$ on $x$ is:
  $(x \rightarrow_{g} g \cdot x \rightarrow_{s'} g \cdot x \rightarrow_{g^{-1}} x)$.

Hence, both containments are proved.

#### Backward: if all elements in the orbit have the same orbit, then the stabilizer is normal.

From the above equation $Stab(g \cdot x) = g Stab(x) g^{-1}$. If the
entire orbit has the same stabilizer, $Stab (g \cdot x) = Stab(x)$. Hence,
we get $Stab(x) = g Stab(x) g^{-1}$, proving that it's normal.

## [Handy characterization of adding an element into an ideal, proof that maximal ideal is prime](#handy-characterization-of-adding-an-element-into-an-ideal-proof-that-maximal-ideal-is-prime)

##### The characterization

Let $I$ be an ideal. The ideal generated by adding $(a \in R)$ to $I$ is
defined as $A \equiv (I \cup \{ a\})$. We prove that $A = I + aR$.


$$
\begin{align*}
&(I \cup \{a \})  \\
&= \quad \{ \alpha i + \beta a | i \in I, \alpha, \beta \in R \} \\
&= \quad \{ i' + \beta a | i' \in I, \alpha, \beta \in R \} \qquad \text{($I$ is closed under multiplication by $R$)} \\
&= I + aR
\end{align*}
$$

##### Quotient based proof that maximal ideal is prime

An ideal $P$ is prime iff the quotient ring $R/P$ is an integral domain. An
ideal $M$ is maximal $R/M$ is a field. Every field is an integral domain,
hence:

$M \text{ is maximal } \implies R/M \text{ is a field } \implies R/M \text {is an integral domain} \implies M \text{ is prime}$.

I was dissatisfied with this proof, since it is not ideal theoretic: It argues
about the behaviour of the quotients. I then found this proof that argues
purly using ideals:

#### Ideal theoretic proof that maximal ideal is prime

##### Sketch
Let $I$ be a maximal ideal. Let $a, b \in R$ such that $ab \in I$. We need
to prove that $a \in I \lor b \in I$. If $a \in I$, the problem is done.
So, let $a \notin I$. Build ideal $A = (I \cup {a})$. $I \subsetneq A$. Since
$I$ is maximal, $A = R$. Hence, there are solutions for
$1_R \in A \implies 1_r \in I + aR \implies \exists i \in I, r \in R, 1_R = i  + ar$.
Now, $b = b \cdot 1_R = b(i + ar) = bi + (ba)r \in I + IR = I$. ($ba \in I$ by assumption).
Hence, $b \in I$.


##### Details

let $i$ be a maximal ideal. let $a, b \in r$ such that $ab \in i$. we need
to prove that $a \in i \lor b \in i$.

if $a \in i$, then the problem is done. so, let $a \notin i$. consider
the ideal $A$ generated by adding $a$ into $I$. $A \equiv (I \cup \{a\})$.

We have shown that $A = I + aR$. Hence, $I + a0 = I \subset A$.
Also, $0 + ac \dot 1 = a \in A$, $a \neq I$ \implies $A \neq I$. Therefore,
$I \subsetneq A$. Since $I$ is maximal, this means that $A = R$

Therefore, $I + aR = R$. Hence, there exists some $i \in I, r \in R$ such
that $i + ar = 1_R$.

Now, $b = b \cdot 1_R = b \cdot (i + ar) = bi + (ba) r \in I + IR = I$ Hence,
$b \in I$.



## [Radical ideals, nilpotents, and reduced rings](#radical-ideals-nilpotents-and-reduced-rings)

##### Radical Ideals
A radical ideal of a ring $R$ is an ideal such that
$\forall r \in R, r^n \in I \implies r \in I$.
That is, if any power of $r$ is in $I$, then the element
$r$ also gets "sucked into" $I$.

##### Nilpotent elements
A nilpotent element of a ring $R$ is any element $r$ such that there exists
some power $n$ such that $r^n = 0$.

Note that every ideal of the ring contains $0$. Hence, if an ideal $I$
of a ring is known to be a radical ideal, then for any nilpotent $r$,
since $\exists n, r^n = 0 \in I$, since $I$ is radical, $r \in I$.

That is, _a radical ideal with always contain all nilpotents!_ It will
contain other elements as well, but it will contain nilpotents for sure.

##### Radicalization of an ideal
Given a ideal $I$, it's radical idea $\sqrt I \equiv \{ r \in R, r^n \in I \}$.
That is, we add all the elements $I$ needs to have for it to become a radical.

Notice that the radicalization of the zero ideal $I$ will precisely contain
all nilpotents. that is, $\sqrt{(0)} \equiv \{ r \in R, r^n = 0\}$.

##### Reduced rings
A ring $R$ is a reduced ring if the only nilpotent in the ring is $0$.

##### creating reduced rings (removing nilpotents) by quotienting radical ideals
Tto remove nilpotents of the ring $R$, we can create $R' \equiv R / \sqrt{(0}$. Since
$\sqrt{(0)}$ is the ideal which contains all nilpotents, the quotient ring $R'$ will contain
no nilpotents other than $0$.

Similarly, quotienting by any larger radical ideal $I$ will remove all nilpotents
(and then some), leaving a reduced ring.

> A ring modulo a radical ideal is reduced

##### Integral domains
a Ring $R$ is an integral domain if $ab = 0 \implies a = 0 \lor b = 0$. That is,
the ring $R$ has no zero divisors.

##### Prime ideals

An ideal $I$ of a ring $R$ is a prime ideal if
$\forall xy \in R, xy \in I \implies x \in I \lor y \in I$. This generalizes
the notion of a prime number diving a composite: $p | xy \implies p | x \lor p | y$.

##### creating integral domains by quotenting prime ideals

Recall that every ideal contains a $0$. Now, if an ideal $I$ is prime, and if
$ab = 0 \in I$, then either $a \in I$ or $b \in I$ (by the definition of prime).

We create $R' = R / I$. We denote $\overline{r} \in R'$ as the image of $r \in R$
in the quotient ring $R'$.

The intuition is that quotienting by a  $I$, since if $ab = 0 \implies a \in I \lor b \in I$,
we are "forcing" that in the quotient ring $R'$, if $\overline{a} \overline{b} = 0$, then either
$\overline{a} = 0$ or $\overline{b} = 0$, since $(a \in I \implies \overline a = 0)$,
and $b \in I \implies \overline b = 0)$.

> A ring modulo a prime ideal is an integral domain.


I learnt of this explanation from this
[excellent blog post by Stefano Ottolenghi](http://quickmathintuitions.org/relationship-between-reduced-rings-radical-ideals-and-nilpotent-elements/).

## [My disenchantment with abstract interpretation](#my-disenchantment-with-abstract-interpretation)

When I first ran across the theory of abstract interpretation, it seemed magical:
Define two functions, check that they're monotone maps, and boom, we have
on our hands an analysis.

However, the problem appears to be that in reality, it's not as simple. Here is
the list of issues I've run across when trying to use abstract interpretation
for a "real world" use-case:


First of all, all interesting lattices are infinte height, requiring some
choice of widening.  Defining a good widening is a black art.  Secondly, while
there is a lot of theory on combining abstract domains (reduced products and
the like), it seems hard to deploy the theory in the real world.

I read a fair bit into the theory of abstract acceleration, where the idea is
that instead of widening indiscriminately, if our theory is powerful enough to
compute an exact closed form, we choose to do so. However, the problem is that
this regime does not "fit well" into abstract interpretation: We have the
abstract interpreter on the one hand, and then the acceleration regime on the
other, which is a separate algorithm. So the full analysis looks something
like:

```python
def analyze(program):
  analysis = {}
  for loop in inner to outer:
     loop_data = abstract_interpret(loop)
     analaysis.append(accelerate(loop))
  return analysis
```

That is, what used to be a nice theory of just "do things in any order and
it will converge", now becomes a new algorithm, that uses abstract interpretation
as a subroutine. This was not the hope I had! I wanted to _get away_ from having
to do proofs by analyzing an algorithm, this was the entire promise: Define
a lattice well enough and the proof is guaranteed. Rather, what I had
imagined was:

```python
def analyze(program):
  return abstract_interpret_using_acceleration_domain(program)
```

Now this `acceleration_domain` maybe frightfully complicated, but I'm willing
to pay that price, as long as it's an honest-to-god abstract interpretation.
This was a huge bummer for me to find out that this is not the case.


## [Computing equivalent gate sets using grobner bases](#computing-equivalent-gate-sets-using-grobner-bases)

Here's a fun little problem, whose only solution I know involves a fair
bit of math and computer algebra:

We are given the grammar for a language `L`:

```
E = T +_mod8 E | T -_mod8 E | T
T = V | V ^ V | V ^ V ^ V
V = 'a1' | 'a2' | ...
```


where `+_mod8` is addition modulo 8, `-_mod8` is subtraction modulo 8,
and `^` is XOR.

This language is equipped with the obvious
evaluation rules, corresponding to those of arithmetic. We are guaranteed
that during evaluation, the variables `a_i` will only have values `0` and `1`.
Since we have addition, we can perform multiplication by a constant
by repeated addition. So we can perform `3*a` as `a+a+a`.


We are then given the input expression `(a0 ^ a1 ^ a2 ^ a3)`. We wish
to find an equivalent expression in terms of the above language `L`.

We think of `E` as some set of logic gates we are allowed to use, and we are
trying to express the operation `(a0 ^ a1 ^ a2 ^ a3)` in terms of these gates.

The first idea that I thought was that of employing a grobner basis,
since they essentially embody rewrite rules modulo polynomial equalities, which
is precisely our setting here.

In this blog post, I'm going to describe what a grobner basis is and why it's
natural to reach for them to solve this problem, the code, and the eventual
solution.

As a spolier, the solution is:

```
a^b^c^d =
-a - b + c + 3*d - 3*axorb - axorc
+ axord - bxorc + bxord + 3*cxord
- 3*axorbxorc - axorbxord
+ axorcxord + bxorcxord
```

Clearly, this contains only additions/subtractions and multiplications by
a constant.

If there's some principled way to derive this (beyond throwing symbolic
algebra machinery), I'd really love to know ---
[Please raise an issue with the explanation!](https://github.com/bollu/bollu.github.io/issues)

##### What the hell is Grobner Basis?

The nutshell is that a grobner basis is a way to construct rewrite rules which
also understand arithmetic (I learnt this viewpoint from the book "Term
rewriting and all that". Fantastic book in general). Expanding on the
nutshell, assume we have a term rewriting system:

```
A -> -1*B -- (1)
C -> B^2  -- (2)
```

over an alphabet `{A, B, C}`.

Now, given the string `C + AB`, we wish to find out if it can be rewritten to
`0` or not. Let's try to substitute and see what happens:

```
C + AB -2-> B^2 + AB -1-> B^2 + (-1*B)B
```

At this point, we're stuck! we don't have rewrite rules to allow us to
rewrite `(-1*B)B` into `-B^2`. Indeed, creating such a list would be
infinitely long. But if we are willing to accept that we somehow have
the rewrite rules that correspond to polynomial arithmetic, where we view
`A, B, C` as variables, then we _can_ rewrite the above string to 0:

```
B^2 + (-1*B)B -> B^2 - B^2 -> 0
```

A Grobner basis is the algorithmic / mathematical machine that allows us
to perform this kind of substitution.

In this example, this might appear stupid: what is so special? We simply
substituted variables and arrived at `0` by using arithmetic. What's
so complicated about that? To understand why this is not always so easy,
let's consider a pathological, specially constructed example


##### A complicated example that shatters dreams

Here's the pathological example:

```
A -> 1     -- (1)
AB -> -B^2 -- (2)
```

And we consider the string `S = AB + B^2`.  If we blindly apply the
first rule, we arrive at:

```
S = AB + B^2 -1-> 1B + B^2 = B + B^2 (STUCK)
```

However, if we apply `(2)` and then `(1)`:

```
S = AB + B^2 -2-> -B^2 + B^2 -> 0
```

This tells us that we _can't just apply the rewrite rules willy-nilly_.
It's sensitive to the _order_ of the rewrites! That is, the rewrite system
is not [confluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting)).


The grobner basis is a function from rewrite systems to rewrite systems.
When given a rewrite system `R`, it produces a _new_ rewrite system `R'`
that _is confluent_. So, we can apply the rewrite rules of `R'` in any order,
and we guaranteed that we will only get a 0 from `R'` if and only if
we could have gotten a `0` from `R` for all strings.

We can then go on to phrase this whole rewriting setup in the language of
ideals from ring theory, and that is the language in which it is most
often described. I've gone into more depth on that perspective here: 
["What is a grobner basis? polynomial factorization as rewrite systems"](#what-the-hell-is-a-grobner-basis-ideals-as-rewrite-systems).

Now that we have a handle on what a grobner basis is, let's go on to solve
the original problem:


##### An explanation through a slightly simpler problem

I'll first demonstrate the idea of how to solve the original problem
by solving a slightly simpler problem:

> Rewrite `a^b^c` in terms of `a^b`, `b^c`, `c^a` and the same `+_mod8` instruction
> set as the original problem. The only difference this time
> is that we do _not_ have `T -> V ^ V ^ V`.


The idea is to construct the polynomial ring over `Z/8Z` (integers modulo 8) with
variables as `a, b, c, axorb, bxorc, axorc`. Now, we know that `a^b = a + b - 2ab`. So,
we setup rewrite rules such that `a + b - 2ab -> axorb`, `b + c - 2bc -> bxorb`,
`c + a - 2ca -> cxora`.


We construct the _polynomial_ `f(a, b, c) = a^b^c`, which
has been written in terms of addition and multiplication, defined
as `f_orig(a, b, c) = 4*a*b*c - 2*a*b - 2*a*c - 2*b*c + a + b + c`. We then
rewrite `f_orig` with respect to our rewrite rules. Hopefully, the rewrite
rules should give us a clean expression in terms of one variable and
two-variable `xor`s. There is the danger that we may have some term
such as `a * bxorc`, and we do get such a term (`2*b*axorc`) in this case,
but it does not appear in the _original_ problem.



```py
## Create ring with variables a, b, c, axorb, bxorc, axorc
R = IntegerModRing(8)['a, b, c, axorb, bxorc, axorc']
(a, b, c, axorb, bxorc, axorc) = R.gens()


## xor of 2 numbers as a polynomial
def xor2(x, y): return x + y - 2*x*y

## xor of 3 numbers as a polynomial
def xor3(x, y, z): return xor2(x, xor2(y, z))

## define the ideal which contains relations:
## xor2(a, b) -> axorb, xor2(b, c) -> bxorc, xor2(a, c) -> axorc
## we also add the relation (a^2 - a = 0 => a = 0 or a = 1)
## since we know that our variables are only {0, 1}
I = ideal((axorb - xor2(a, b), bxorc - xor2(b, c), axorc - xor2(a, c), a*a-a, b*b-b, c*c-c))

## the polynomial representing a^b^c we wish to reduce
f_orig = xor3(a, b, c)

## we take the groebner basis of the ring to reduce the polynomial f.
IG = I.groebner_basis()

## we reduce a^b^c with respect to the groebner basis.
f_reduced = f_orig.reduce(IG)

print("value of a^b^c:\n\t%s\n\treduced: %s" % (f_orig, f_reduced))

## Code to evaluate the function `f` on all inputs to check correctness
def evalxor2(f):
    for (i, j, k) in [(i, j, k) for i in [0, 1] for j in [0, 1] for k in [0, 1]]:
      ref = i^^j^^k
      eval = f.substitute(a=i, b=j, c=k, axorb=i^^j, bxorc=j^^k, axorc=i^^k)
      print("%s^%s^%s: ref(%s) =?= f(%s): %s" %
        (i, j, k, ref, eval, ref == eval))

## check original formulation is correct
print("evaulating original f for sanity check:")
evalxor2(f_orig)

## Check reduced formulation is correct
print("evaulating reduced f:")
evalxor2(f_reduced)
```

Running the code gives us the reduced polynomial `-2*b*axorc + b + axorc`
which unfortunately contains a term that is `b * axorc`. So, this approach
does not work, and I was informed by my friend that she is unaware
of a solution to this problem (writing `a^b^c` in terms of smaller xors and
sums).


The full code output is:

```
value of a^b^c:
	4*a*b*c - 2*a*b - 2*a*c - 2*b*c + a + b + c
	reduced: -2*b*axorc + b + axorc
evaulating original f for sanity check:
0^0^0: ref(0) =?= f(0): True
0^0^1: ref(1) =?= f(1): True
0^1^0: ref(1) =?= f(1): True
0^1^1: ref(0) =?= f(0): True
1^0^0: ref(1) =?= f(1): True
1^0^1: ref(0) =?= f(0): True
1^1^0: ref(0) =?= f(0): True
1^1^1: ref(1) =?= f(1): True
evaulating reduced f:
0^0^0: ref(0) =?= f(0): True
0^0^1: ref(1) =?= f(1): True
0^1^0: ref(1) =?= f(1): True
0^1^1: ref(0) =?= f(0): True

1^0^1: ref(0) =?= f(0): True
1^1^0: ref(0) =?= f(0): True
1^1^1: ref(1) =?= f(1): True
```

That is, both the original polynomial and the reduced polynomial match
the expected results. But the reduced polynomial is not in our language `L`,
since it has a term that is a _product_ of `b` with `axorc`.


##### Tacking the original problem.

We try the exact same approach to the original problem of expressing
`a ^ b ^ c ^ d`. We find that the reduced polynomial is

```
-a - b + c + 3*d - 3*axorb - axorc
+ axord - bxorc + bxord + 3*cxord
- 3*axorbxorc - axorbxord
+ axorcxord + bxorcxord
```

which happily has no products between terms! It also passes our sanity
check, so we've now found the answer.

The full output is:
```

	4*a*b*c + 4*a*b*d + 4*a*c*d + 4*b*c*d

## [Generating `k` bitsets of a given length `n`](#generating-k-bitsets-of-a-given-length-n):

The problem is to generate all bitvectors of length `n` that have `k` bits
set. For example, generate all bitvectors of length `5` that have `3` bits
set.

I know that an algorithm exists in Hacker's delight, but I've been too sick
to crack open a book, so I decided to discover the algorithm myself. The one
I came up with relies on looking at the numbers moving at a certain velocity,
and them colliding with each other. For example, let us try to generate all
`5C3` combinations of bits.


We start wih:
```
#1           count of position
a b c d e    positions
1 1 1 0 0    bitset
< - - - -    velocity
```

Where the `<` represents that the `1` at position `a` is moving leftwards.
Our arena is _circular_, so the leftmost `1` can wrap around to the right.
This leads to the next state

```
#2
a b c d e
0 1 1 0 1
- - - - <
```

We continue moving left peacefully.

```
#3
a b c d e
0 1 1 1 0
- - - < -
```

whoops, we have now collided with a block of `1`s. Not to worry, we simply
transfer our velocity by way of collision, from the `1` at `d` to the `1` at `b`.

I denote the transfer as follows:
```
#3
a b c d e
0 1 1 1 0  original state
- - - < -
- < < < -  transfer of velocity
- < - - -  final state after transfer of velocity
```

The `1` at `b` proceeds along its merry way with the given velocity

```
#4
a b c d e
1 0 1 1 0
< - - - -
```

Once again, it wraps around, and suffers a collision

```
#5
a b c d e
0 0 1 1 1
- - - - - < (collision, transfer)
- - < < < transfer of velocity
- - < - - final state after transfer of velocity
```

This continues:

```
0 1 0 1 1  #6
- < - - -
1 0 0 1 1  #7
< - - - - (collision, transfer velocity)
< - - < <
- - - < -
1 0 1 0 1 #8
- - < - -
1 1 0 0 1 #9
- < - - - (colision, transfer velocity
< < - - <
- - - - <
1 1 0 1 0 #10
- - - < -
1 1 1 0 0 #11: wrap around to initial state
```

I don't have a proof of correctness, but I have an intuition that this
should generate all states. Does anyone have a proof?

_EDIT:_ [this algorithm does not work](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3398241/correctness-proof-for-algorithm-to-generate-k-bitsets-of-n-bits-nck),
since it will keep clusters of $k-1$ bits next to each other, when a
bit hits a cluster of $k - 1$ bits.  For completeness, I'm going to draft out
the usual algorithm in full:

### Usual Algorithm

Let's consider the same example of `5C3`:

```
   a b c d e
1| 0 0 1 1 1 (LSB)
```

We start with all bits at their lowest position. Now, we try to go to
the next smallest number, which still has 3 bits toggled. Clearly, we need
the bit at position `b` to be 1, since that's the next number. Then,
we can keep the lower 2 bits `d, e` set to 1, so that it's still as small a
number as possible.

```
   a b c d e
2| 0 1 0 1 1 (LSB)
```

Once again, we now move the digit at `d` to the digit at `c`, while keeping
the final digit at `e` to make sure it's still the smallest possible.

```
   a b c d e
3| 0 1 1 0 1 (LSB)
```

Now, we can move the `1` at `e` to `d`, since that will lead to the smallest
increase:

```
   a b c d e
4| 0 1 1 1 0 (LSB)
```

At this point, we are forced to move to location `a`, since we have exhausted
all smaller locations. so we move the `1` at `b` to `a`, and then reset all
the other bits to be as close to the LSB as possible:

```
   a b c d e
5| 1 0 0 1 1 (LSB)
```

Continuing this process gives us the rest of the sequence:

```
    a b c d e
5 | 1 0 0 1 1
6 | 1 0 1 0 1
7 | 1 0 1 1 0
8 | 1 1 0 0 1 (note the reset of d!)
9 | 1 1 0 1 0
10| 1 1 1 0 0
```
## [Bondi k-calculus](#bondi-k-calculus)

- [Link here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_k-calculus)

An alternative formalism to derive special relativity geometrically,
resting purely on hypotehses about the way light travels.

However, I've not been able to prove the correctness of the assumptions made,
by using coordinate geometry. I suspect this is because I will need to use
hyperbolic geometry for the "side lengths" to work out.


Indeed, I found another source, called as [The k-calculus fiddle](http://bearsoft.co.uk/Kcalc.html)
which attempts to discredit k-calculus. The author of the above blog writes at
the end:

> In asking Ray D'Inverno's permission to use his book as the example of
> k-calculus, he was kind enough to point out that the arguments I have given

> reread in the light of the fact that the geometry of space and time is

> diagrams because their geometry is Minkowskian.

which seems to imply that we need to use hyperbolic geometry for this.

## [Vivado toolchain craziness ](#vivado-toolchain-craziness)

I found this file as I was cleaning up some old code, for a project to implement
a [fast K/V store on an FPGA](https://github.com/AakashKT/CuckooHashingHLS),
so I thought I should put this up for anyone else who stumbles on the
same frustrations / errors. I'm not touching this particular toolchain again
with a 10-foot pole till the tools stabilize by *a lot*.

##### Vivado HLS issues


- Unable to create BRAM for fields such as `bool`, `int16`. The data buses
  will be `8/16` bits long, with error:

```
[BD 41-241] Message from IP propagation TCL of /blk_mem_gen_7: set_property
error: Validation failed for parameter 'Write Width A(Write_Width_A)' for BD
Cell 'blk_mem_gen_7'. Value '8' is out of the range (32,1024) Customization
errors found on 'blk_mem_gen_7'. Restoring to previous valid configuration.
```

- I had an array of structs:

```cpp
struct S {
    bool b;
    int16 x;
    int16 y;
}
```

This gets generated as 3 ports for memory, of widths `1`, `16`, `16`. Ideally,
I wanted *one* port, of width `16+16+1=33`, for each struct value.
However, what was generated were three ports of widths `1`, `16`, and `16`
which I cannot connect to BRAM.

- `data_pack` allows us to create one port of width `16+16+1=33`

- Shared function names allocated on BRAM causes errors in synthesis:


```cpp
struct Foo {...};
void f (Foo conflict) {
    #pragma HLS interface bram port=conflict
}

void g (Foo conflict) {
    #pragma HLS interface bram port=conflict
}
```

- Enums causes compile failure in RTL generation  (commit `3c0d619039cff7a7abb61268e6c8bc6d250d8730`)
- `ap_int` causes compile failurre in RTL generation (commit `3c0d619039cff7a7abb61268e6c8bc6d250d8730`)
- `x % m` where `m != 2^k` is very expensive -- there must be faster encodings of modulus?
- How to share code between HLS and vivado SDK? I often wanted to share constant values between
  my HLS code and my Zynq code.
- Can't understand why array of structs that were packed does not get deserialized correctly. I had to manually
  pack a struct into a `uint32`. For whatever reason, having a `#pragma pack` did something to the representation of the struct
  as far as I can tell, and I couldn't treat the memory as just a raw `struct *` on the other side:


```cpp
// HLS side
struct Vec2  { int x; int y};
void f(Vec2 points[NUM_POINTS]) {
	#pragma HLS DATA_PACK variable=points
    #pragma HLS INTERFACE bram port=points

    points[0] = {2, 3};
}

// Host side
Vec2 *points = (Vec2 *)(0xPOINTER_LOCATION_FROM_VIVADO);

int main() {
    // points[0] will *not* be {2, 3}!
}
```

- If I change my IP, there is no way to preserve the current connections in the
  GUI why just updating the "changed connections". I'm forced to remove the IP
  and add it again (no, the Refresh IP button does not work).
- On generating a new bitstream from Vivado, Vivado SDK tries to reload the config,
  fails at the reloading (thinks `xil_print.h` doesn't exist), and then fails to compile code.
  Options are to either restart Vivado SDK, or refresh `xil_print.h`.


- It is entirely unclear what to version control in a vivado project, unless one
  has an omniscient view of the _entire toolchain_. I resorted to `git add` ing
  everything, but this is a terrible strategy in so many ways.


#### SDAccel bugs

**[link to tutorial we were following](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/sw_manuals/xilinx2017_1/ug1028-sdsoc-intro-tutorial.pdf)**
- The executable is named `.exe` while it's actually an ELF executable (The SDAccel tutorials say it is called as `.elf`)
- the board is supposed to automatically boot into linux, which it does not. One is expected to call `bootd` manually (for "boot default") so it boots ito linux. (The SDAccel tutorials say it automatically boots into it)
- At this point, the SD card is unreadable. It took a bunch of time to figure out that the SD card needs to be mounted by us, and has the mount name `/dev/mmcblk0p1`. (The SDAccel tutorials say that it should be automatically mounted)
- At this point, we are unable to run `hashing.elf`. It dies with a truly bizarre error: `hashing.elf: command not found`. This is almost un-googleable, due to the fact that the same problem occurs when people don't have the correct file name.
- I rewrote `ls` with `hashing.elf` to see what would happen, because I conjectured that the shell was able to run `coreutils`.
- This dies with a different error `ls: core not found`. I'd luckily seen this during my android days, and knew this was from busybox.
- This led me to google "busybox unable to execute executable", which led me to this [StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1562071/how-can-i-find-which-elf-dependency-is-not-fulfilled) that clued me into the fact that the ELF interpreter is missing.
- When I discovered this, I wound up trying to understand how to get the right ELF interpreter. `readelf -l <exe name>` dumps out `[Requesting program interpreter: /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3]`. So, I bravely copied: `cp /lib/ld-linux.so.3 /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3`.
- Stuff is *still* broken, but I now get *useful* error messages:

```
zynq> /hashing.elf
/hashing.elf: error while loading shared libraries:
libxilinxopencl.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

At this point, clearly we have some linker issues (why does `xocc` not correctly statically link? What's up with it? Why does it expect it to be able to load a shared library? **WTF is happening**). do note that this is _not_ the way the process
is supposed to go according to the tutorial!
- Of course, there's no static library version of `libxilinxopencl.so`, so that's a dead end. I'm completely unsure if the tutorial even makes sense.
- This entire chain of debugging is full of luck.

- [Link talking about generating `BOOT` file](https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2018_2/sdsoc_doc/compiling-and-running-applications-on-arm-processor-hjy1504034381720.html)


At some point, I gave up on the entire enterprise.

## [What the hell _is_ a Grobner basis? Ideals as rewrite systems](#what-the-hell-is-a-grobner-basis-ideals-as-rewrite-systems)

##### A motivating example

The question a Grobner basis allows us to answer is this: can the polynomial
$p(x, y) = xy^2 + y$ be factorized in terms of $a(x, y) = xy + 1, b(x, y) = y^2 - 1$,
such that $p(x, y) = f(x, y) a(x, y) + g(x, y) b(x, y)$ for some _arbitrary_ polynomials
$f(x, y), g(x, y) \in R[x, y]$.

One might imagine, "well, I'll divide and see what happens!" Now, there are two
routes to go down:

- $xy^2 + y = y(xy + 1) = y a(x, y) + 0 b(x, y)$. Well, problem solved?
- $xy^2 + y = xy^2 - x + x + y = x (y^2 - 1) + x + y = x b(x, y) + (x + y)$. Now what? we're stuck, and we can't apply `a(x, y)`!

So, clearly, the _order_ in which we perform of factorization / division starts
to matter! Ideally, we want an algorithm which is _not sensitive_ to the order
in which we choose to apply these changes. $x^2 + 1$.


##### The rewrite rule perspective


An alternative viewpoint of asking "can this be factorized", is to ask
"can we look at the factorization as a rewrite rule"? For this perspective,
notice that "factorizing" in terms of $xy + 1$ is the same as being
able to set $xy = -1$, and then have the polynomial collapse to zero.
(For the more algebraic minded, this relates to the fact that $R[x] / p(x) \sim R(\text{roots of p})$).
The intuition behind this is that when we "divide by $xy + 1$", really what
we are doing is we are setting $xy + 1 = 0$, and then seeing what remains. But
$xy + 1 = 0 \iff xy = -1$. Thus, we can look at the original question as:

How can we apply the rewrite rules $xy \rightarrow -1$, $y^2 \rightarrow 1$,
along with the regular rewrite rules of polynomial arithmetic to the polynomial
$p(x, y) = xy^2 + y$, such that we end with the value $0$?

Our two derivations above correspond to the application of the rules:

- $xy^2 + y \xrightarrow{xy = -1} -y + y = 0$
- $xy^2 + y \xrightarrow{y^2 = 1} x + y \nrightarrow \text{stuck!}$

That is, our [rewrite rules are not confluent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confluence_(abstract_rewriting))

The grobner basis is a mathematical object, which is a  _a confluent set of rewrite rules_
for the above problem. That is, it's a set of polynomials which manage to find
the rewrite $p(x, y) \xrightarrow{\star} 0$, regardless of the order in which
we apply them. It's also _correct_, in that it only rewrites to $0$ if the
original system had _some way_ to rewrite to $0$.

###### The buchberger's algorithm

We need to identify
[critical pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pair_(logic)),
which in this setting are called as S-polynomials.

Let $f_i = H(f_i) + R(f_i)$ and $f_j = H(f_j) + R(f_j)$. Let $m = lcm(H(f_i), H(f_j))$,
and let $m_i, m_j$ be monomials such that $m_i \cdot H(f_i) = m = m_j \cdot H(f_j)$.
The S-polynomial induced by $f_i, f_j$ is defined as $S(f_i, f_j) = m_i f_i - m_i f_j$.

## [Lie bracket versus torsion](lie-bracket-versus-torsion)


<img width=200 height=200 src="static/lie-bracket-versus-torsion.png">

This picture _finally_ made the difference between these two things clear.
The lie bracket moves along the _flow_, while the torsion moves along
_parallel transport_.

This is why the sides of the parallelogram that measure torsion form,
well, a parallelogram: we set them up using parallel transport.

On the other hand, the lie bracket measures the actual failure of the parallelogram
from being formed.

## [Everything you know about word2vec is wrong](#everything-you-know-about-word2vec-is-wrong)

The classic explanation of `word2vec`, in skip-gram, with negative sampling,
in the paper and countless blog posts on the internet is as follows:

```
while(1) {
   1. vf = vector of focus word
   2. vc = vector of context word
   3. train such that (vc . vf = 1)
   4. for(0 <= i < negative samples):
           vneg = vector of word *not* in context
           train such that (vf . vneg = 0)
}
```

Indeed, if I google "word2vec skipgram", the results I get are:
- [The wikipedia page which describes the algorithm on a high level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec#Training_algorithm)
- [The tensorflow page with the same explanation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/representation/word2vec)
- [The towards data science blog which describes the same algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/word2vec-skip-gram-model-part-1-intuition-78614e4d6e0b)

the list goes on. However, __every single one of these implementations is wrong__.

The original word2vec `C` implementation does _not_ do what's explained above,
and is _drastically different_. Most serious users of word embeddings, who use
embeddings generated from `word2vec` do one of the following things:

1. They invoke the original C implementation directly.
2. They invoke the `gensim` implementation, which is _transliterated_ from the
   C source to the extent that the variables names are the same.

Indeed, the `gensim` implementation is the 
__only one that I know of which is faithful to the C implementation__.

### The C implementation

The C implementation in fact maintains _two vectors for each word_, one where
it appears as a focus word, and one where it appears as a context word.
(Is this sounding familiar? Indeed, it appears that GloVe actually took this
idea from `word2vec`, which has never mentioned this fact!)

The setup is incredibly well done in the C code:

- An array called `syn0` holds the vector embedding of a word when it occurs
  as a _focus word_. This is __random initialized__.

```cpp

    syn0[a * layer1_size + b] =
       (((next_random & 0xFFFF) / (real)65536) - 0.5) / layer1_size;
  }

```

- Another array called `syn1neg` holds the vector of a word when it occurs
  as a _context word_. This is __zero initialized__.

```cpp
https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/blob/20c129af10659f7c50e86e3be406df663beff438/word2vec.c#L365
for (a = 0; a < vocab_size; a++) for (b = 0; b < layer1_size; b++)
  syn1neg[a * layer1_size + b] = 0;
```

- During training (skip-gram, negative sampling, though other cases are
  also similar), we first pick a focus word. This is held constant throughout
  the positive and negative sample training. The gradients of the focus vector
  are accumulated in a buffer, and are applied to the focus word
  _after it has been affected by both positive and negative samples_.

```cpp
if (negative > 0) for (d = 0; d < negative + 1; d++) {
  // if we are performing negative sampling, in the 1st iteration,
  // pick a word from the context and set the dot product target to 1
  if (d == 0) {
    target = word;
    label = 1;
  } else {
    // for all other iterations, pick a word randomly and set the dot
    //product target to 0
    next_random = next_random * (unsigned long long)25214903917 + 11;
    target = table[(next_random >> 16) % table_size];
    if (target == 0) target = next_random % (vocab_size - 1) + 1;
    if (target == word) continue;
    label = 0;
  }
  l2 = target * layer1_size;
  f = 0;

  // find dot product of original vector with negative sample vector
  // store in f
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) f += syn0[c + l1] * syn1neg[c + l2];

  // set g = sigmoid(f) (roughly, the actual formula is slightly more complex)
  if (f > MAX_EXP) g = (label - 1) * alpha;
  else if (f < -MAX_EXP) g = (label - 0) * alpha;
  else g = (label - expTable[(int)((f + MAX_EXP) * (EXP_TABLE_SIZE / MAX_EXP / 2))]) * alpha;

  // 1. update the vector syn1neg,
  // 2. DO NOT UPDATE syn0
  // 3. STORE THE syn0 gradient in a temporary buffer neu1e
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) neu1e[c] += g * syn1neg[c + l2];
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) syn1neg[c + l2] += g * syn0[c + l1];
}
// Finally, after all samples, update syn1 from neu1e

// Learn weights input -> hidden
for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) syn0[c + l1] += neu1e[c];
```

### Why random and zero initialization?

Once again, since none of this actually explained in the original papers
_or on the web_, I can only hypothesize.

My hypothesis is that since the negative samples come from all over the text
and are not really weighed by frequency, you can wind up picking _any word_,
and more often than not, _a word whose vector has not been trained much at all_.
If this vector actually had a value, then it could move the actually important
focus word randomly.

The solution is to set all negative samples to zero, so that 
_only vectors that have occurred somewhat frequently_ will affect the representation 
of another vector.

It's quite ingenious, really, and until this, I'd never really thought of
how important initialization strategies really are.


### Why I'm writing this

I spent two months of my life trying to reproduce `word2vec`, following
the paper exactly, reading countless articles, and simply not succeeding.
I was unable to reach the same scores that `word2vec` did, and it was not
for lack of trying.

I could not have imagined that the paper would have literally fabricated an
algorithm that doesn't work, while the implementation does something completely
different.

Eventually, I decided to read the sources, and spent three whole days convinced
I was reading the code wrong since literally everything on the internet told me
otherwise.

I don't understand why the original paper and the internet contain zero
explanations of the _actual_ mechanism behind `word2vec`, so I decided to put
it up myself.

This also explains GloVe's radical choice of having a separate vector
for the negative context --- they were just doing what `word2vec` does, but
they told people about it `:)`.

Is this academic dishonesty? I don't know the answer, and that's a heavy
question. But I'm frankly incredibly pissed, and this is probably the last
time I take a machine learning paper's explanation of the algorithm
seriously again --- from next time, I read the source _first_.

## Hamiltonian monte carlo, leapfrog integrators, and sympletic geometry

This is a section that I'll update as I learn more about the space, since I'm studying
differential geometry over the summer, I hope to know enough about "sympletic manifolds".
I'll make this an append-only log to add to the section as I understand more.

##### 31st May

- To perform hamiltonian monte carlo, we use the hamiltonian and its
  derivatives to provide a momentum to our proposal distribution --- That is,
  when we choose a new point from the current point, our probability
  distribution for the new point is influenced by our current momentum.

- For some integral necessary within this scheme, Euler integration doesn't cut it
  since the error diverges to infinity

- Hence, we need an integrator that guarantees that the energy of out system is
  conserved.  Enter the leapfrog integrator. This integrator is also 
  _time reversible_ -- We can run it forward for `n` steps, and then run it
  backward for `n` steps to arrive at the same state.  Now I finally know how
  Braid was implemented, something that bugged the hell out of 9th grade me
  when I tried to implement Braid-like physics in my engine!

- The actual derivation of the integrator uses Lie algebras, Sympletic
  geometry, and other diffgeo ideas, which is great, because it gives me
  motivation to study differential geometry `:)`

- Original paper: [Construction of higher order sympletic integrators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0375960190900923)

##### Simulating orbits with large timesteps

<img width=200 height=200 src="./static/leapfrog-vs-euler.png">

Clearly, the leapfrog integrator preserves energy and continues to move
in an orbit, while the euler integrator goes batshit and causes orbits
to spiral outwards. Full code is available below. More of the code is
spent coaxing matplotlib to look nice, than doing the actual
computation.

```py
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy.linalg

## dq/dt = dH/dp | dp/dt = -dH/dq (a = -del V)
def leapfroge(dhdp, dhdq, q, p, dt):
    p += -dhdq(q, p) * 0.5 * dt # halfstep momentum
    q += dhdp(q, p) * dt # fullstep position
    p += -dhdq(q, p) * 0.5 * dt # halfstep momentum
    return (q, p)

def euler(dhdp, dhdq, q, p, dt):
    pnew = p + -dhdq(q, p) * dt
    qnew = q + dhdp(q, p) * dt

def planet(integrator, n, dt):
    STRENGTH = 0.5

    q = np.array([0.0, 1.0]); p = np.array([-1.0, 0.0])

    # H = STRENGTH * |q| (potential) + p^2/2 (kinetic)
    def H(qcur, pcur): return STRENGTH * np.linalg.norm(q) + np.dot(p, p) / 2
    def dhdp(qcur, pcur): return p
    def dhdq(qcur, pcur): return STRENGTH * 2 * q / np.linalg.norm(q)

    qs = []
    for i in range(n):
        (q, p) = integrator(dhdp, dhdq, q, p, dt)
        qs.append(q.copy())
    return np.asarray(qs)

NITERS = 15
TIMESTEP = 1

## [Small Haskell MCMC implementation](#small-haskell-mcmc-implementation)

We create a simple monad called `PL` which allows for a single operation: sampling
from a uniform distribution. We then exploit this to implement MCMC using metropolis hastings,
which is used to sample from arbitrary distributions. Bonus is a small library to render sparklines
in the CLI.

For next time:

- Using applicative to speed up computations by exploiting parallelism
- Conditioning of a distribution wrt a variable

## Timings of passes in GHC, and low hanging fruit in the backend:

- One can use `-v3` to get pass timings.
- Apparently, GHC spends a lot of time in the simplifier, and time
  spend in the backend is peanuts in comparison to this.

To quote `AndreasK`:

> - Register allocation, common block elimination, block layout and pretty printing are the "slow" things in the backend as far as I remember.
> - There are also a handful of TODO's in the x86 codegen which still apply. So you can try to grep for these.
> - Strength reduction for division by a constant

## Varargs in GHC: `ghc/testsuite/tests/rts/T7160.hs`

A comment from this test case tells us why the function `debugBelch2` exists:

```hs
ghc/testsuite/tests/rts/T7160.hs
-- Don't use debugBelch() directly, because we cannot call varargs functions
-- using the FFI (doing so produces a segfault on 64-bit Linux, for example).
-- See Debug.Trace.traceIO, which also uses debugBelch2.
foreign import ccall "&debugBelch2" fun :: FunPtr (Ptr () -> Ptr () -> IO ())
```

The implementation is:

```c
ghc/libraries/base/cbits/PrelIOUtils.c

void debugBelch2(const char*s, char *t)
{
    debugBelch(s,t);
}
```

```
ghc/rts/RtsMessages.c

RtsMsgFunction *debugMsgFn  = rtsDebugMsgFn;
...

void
debugBelch(const char*s, ...)
{
  va_list ap;
  va_start(ap,s);
  (*debugMsgFn)(s,ap);
  va_end(ap);
}
```
## [Debugging debug info in GHC](#debugging-debug-info-in-GHC)


I wanted to use debug info to help build a better debugging experience
within [`tweag/asterius`](http://github.com/tweag/asterius). So, I was
reading through the sources of `cmm/Debug.hs`.
I'd never considered how to debug debug-info, and I found the information
tucked inside a cute note in GHC (`Note [Debugging DWARF unwinding info]`):

> This makes GDB produce a trace of its internal workings. Having gone this far,
> it's just a tiny step to run GDB in GDB. Make sure you install debugging
> symbols for gdb if you obtain it through a package manager.

## [Handy list of differential geometry definitions](#handy-list-of-differential-geometry-definitions)

There are way too many objects in diffgeo, all of them subtly connected.
Here I catalogue all of the ones I have run across:

##### Manifold

A manifold $M$ of dimension $n$ is a topological space. So, there is a
topological structure $T$ on $M$. There is also an _Atlas_, which is a family
of _Chart_s that satisfy some properties.

##### Chart

A chart is a pair $(O \in  T , cm: O -> \mathbb R^n$. The $O$ is an open set of the
manifold, and $cm$ ("chart for "m") is a continuous mapping from $O$ to $\mathbb R^n$
under the subspace topology for $U$ and the standard topology for $\mathbb R^n$.

#####  Atlas

An _Atlas_ is a collection of _Chart_s such that the charts cover the manifold,
and the charts are pairwise compatible. That is, $A = \{ (U_i, \phi_i) \}$, such
that $\cup{i} U_i = M$, and $\phi_j \circ phi_i^{-1}$ is smooth.

##### Differentiable map

$f: M \to N$ be a mapping from an $m$ dimensional manifold to an $n$ dimensional
manifold. Let $frep = cn \circ f \circ cm^{-1}: \mathbb R^m -> \mathbb R^n$
where $cm: M \to \mathbb R^m$ is a chart for $M$, $cn: N \to \mathbb R^n$
is a chart for $N$. $frep$ is $f$ represented
in local coordinates. If $frep$ is smooth for all choices of $cm, cn$,
then $f$ is a differentiable map from $M$ to $N$.

##### Curve:

Let $I$ be an open interval of $\mathbb R$ which includes the point `0`.  A Curve is a
differentiable map $C: (a, b) \to M$ where $a < 0 < b$.

##### Function: (I hate this term, I prefer something like Valuation):

A differentiable mapping from $M$ to $R$.


##### Directional derivative of a function `f(m): M -> R` with respect to a curve `c(t): I -> M`, denoted as `c[f]`.

Let `g(t) = (f . c)(t) :: I -c-> M -f-> R = I -> R`.
This this is the value `dg/dt(t0) = (d (f . c) / dt) (0)`.

##### Tangent vector at a point `p`:

On a `m` dimensional manifold `M`, a tangent vector at a point `p` is an
equivalence class of curves that have `c(0) = p`, such that `c1(t) ~ c2(t)` iff
:

- For a (all) charts `(O, ch)` such that `c1(0) ∈  O`, `d/dt (ch . c1: R -> R^m) = d/dt (ch . c2: R -> R^m)`.

 That is, they have equal derivatives.

##### Tangent space(`TpM`):

The set of all tangent vectors at a point `p` forms a vector space `TpM`.
We prove this by creating a bijection from every curve to a vector `R^n`.

Let `(U, ch: U -> R)` be a chart around the point `p`, where `p ∈ U ⊆ M`. Now,
the bijection is defined as:

```
forward: (I -> M) -> R^n
forward(c) = d/dt (c . ch)

reverse: R^n -> (I -> M)
reverse(v)(t) = ch^-1 (tv)
```

##### Cotangent space(`TpM*`): dual space of the tangent space / Space of all linear functions from `TpM` to `R`.

- Associated to every function `f`, there is a cotangent vector, colorfully
  called `df`. The definition is `df: TpM -> R`, `df(c: I -> M) = c[f]`. That is,
  given a curve `c`, we take the directional derivative of the function `f`
  along the curve `c`. We need to prove that this is constant for all vectors
  in the equivalence class and blah.

######  Pushforward `push(f): TpM -> TpN`

Given a curve `c: I -> M`, the pushforward
is the curve `f . c : I -> N`. This extends to the equivalence classes
and provides us a way to move curves in `M` to curves in `N`, and thus
gives us a mapping from the tangent spaces.

This satisfies the identity:

```
push(f)(v)[g] === v[g . f]
```

##### Pullback `pull(f): TpN* -> TpM*`

Given a linear functional `wn : TpN -> R`, the pullback is defined as
` wn . push(f) : TpM -> R`.


This satisfies the identity:

```
(pull wn)(v) === wn (push v)
(pull (wn : TpN->R): TpM->R) (v : TpM) : R  = (wn: TpN->R) (push (v: TpM): TpN) : R
```

##### Vector field as derivation

TODO

##### Lie derivation

##### Lie derivation as lie bracket


## [Lazy programs have space leaks, Strict programs have time leaks](#lazy-programs-have-space-leaks-strict-programs-have-time-leaks)

Stumbled across this idea while reading some posts on a private discourse.
- Continually adding new thunks without forcing them can lead to a space leak,
  aka the dreaded monadic parsing backtracking problem.

- Continually _running_ new thunks can lead to a "time leak", where we spend
  far too much time running things that should not be run in the first place!

This is an interesting perspective that I've never seen articulated before, and
somehow helps make space leaks feel more... palatable? Before, I had no
analogue to a space leak in the strict world, so I saw them as a pathology. But
with this new perspective, I can see that the strict world's version of a space
leak is a time leak.

## [Presburger arithmetic can represent the Collatz Conjecture](#presburger-arithmetic-can-represent-the-collatz-conjecture)

An observation I had: the function

```
f(x) = x/2      if (x % 2 == 0)
f(x) = 3x + 1   otherwise
```

is a Presburger function, so by building better approximations to the
transitive closure of a presburger function, one could get better answers
to the Collatz conjecture. Unfortunately, ISL (the integer set library) of today
is not great against the formidable foe.

The code:

```cpp
#include <isl/set.h>
#include <isl/version.h>
#include <isl/map.h>
#include <isl/aff.h>
#include <isl/local_space.h>
#include <isl/constraint.h>
#include <isl/space.h>

int main() {
    isl_ctx *ctx = isl_ctx_alloc();
    const char *s = "{ [x] -> [x / 2] : x % 2 = 0; [x] -> [3 * x + 1] : x % 2 = 1}";

    isl_map *m = isl_map_read_from_str(ctx, s);

    isl_map_dump(m);

    isl_bool b;
    isl_map *p = isl_map_transitive_closure(m, &b);
    printf("exact: %d\n", b);
    printf("map:\n");
    isl_map_dump(p);

}
```

Produces the somewhat disappointing, and yet expected output:

```
$ clang bug.c -lisl -Lisl-0.20/.libs -o bug -I/usr/local/include/
$ ./bug
{ [x] -> [o0] : 2o0 = x or (exists (e0 = floor((1 + x)/2): o0 = 1 + 3x and 2e0 = 1 + x)) }
exact: 0
map:
{ [x] -> [o0] }
```

I find it odd that it is unable to prove _anything_ about the image, even that
it is non-negative, for example. This is an interesting direction in which
to improve the functions `isl_map_power` and `isl_map_transitive_closure`
though.


## [Using compactness to argue about covers](#using-compactness-to-argue-about-covers)

I've always seen compactness be used by _starting_ with a possibly infinite
coverm and then _filtering it_ into a finite subcover. This finite
subcover is then used for finiteness properties (like summing, min, max, etc.).

I recently ran across a use of compactness when one _starts_ with the set
of _all possible subcovers_, and then argues about why a cover cannot be built
from these subcovers if the set is compact. I found it to be a very cool
use of compactness, which I'll record below:

#### Theorem:

If a family of compact, countably infinite sets `S_a` have all
_finite intersections_ non-empty, then the intersection of the family `S_a`
is non-empty.

#### Proof:

Let `S = intersection of S_a`. We know that `S` must be compact since
all the `S_a` are compact, and the intersection of a countably infinite
number of compact sets is compact.

Now, let `S` be empty. Therefore, this means there must be a point `p ∈ P`
such that `p !∈ S_i` for some arbitrary `i`.


#### Cool use of theorem:

We can see that the cantor set is non-empty, since it contains a family
of closed and bounded sets `S1, S2, S3, ...` such that  `S1 ⊇ S2 ⊇ S3 ...`
where each `S_i` is one step of the cantor-ification. We can now see
that the cantor set is non-empty, since:

1. Each finite intersection is non-empty, and will be equal to the set that
   has the highest index in the finite intersection.
2. Each of the sets `Si` are compact since they are closed and bounded subsets of `R`
3. Invoke theorem.

provides a single axiom for groups. This can be useful for some ideas I have
for training groups, where we can use this axiom as the loss function!

## `Word2Vec` C code implements gradient descent really weirdly
I'll be posting snippets of the original source code, along with a
link to the Github sources. We are interested in exploring the skip-gram
implementation of Word2Vec, with negative sampling, without hierarchical
softmax. I assume basic familiarity with word embeddings and the skip-gram
model.

#### Construction of the sigmoid lookup table

```cpp
// https://github.com/tmikolov/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L708

expTable = (real *)malloc((EXP_TABLE_SIZE + 1) * sizeof(real));
for (i = 0; i < EXP_TABLE_SIZE; i++) {
  expTable[i] = exp((i / (real)EXP_TABLE_SIZE * 2 - 1) *
                    MAX_EXP);  // Precompute the exp() table
  expTable[i] =
      expTable[i] / (expTable[i] + 1);  // Precompute f(x) = x / (x + 1)
}
```
Here, the code constructs a lookup table which maps `[0...EXP_TABLE_SIZE-1]`
to `[sigmoid(-MAX_EXP)...sigmoid(MAX_EXP)]`. The index `i` first gets mapped
to `(i / EXP_TABLE_SIZE) * 2 - 1`, which sends `0` to `-1` and `EXP_TABLE_SIZE`
to `1`. This is then rescaled by `MAX_EXP`.

#### Layer initialization

- `syn0` is a global variable, initialized with random weights in the range of
  `[-0.5...0.5]`. It has dimensions `VOCAB x HIDDEN`.  This layer holds the
   hidden representations of word vectors.

```cpp
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L341
a = posix_memalign((void **)&syn0, 128,
               (long long)vocab_size * layer1_size * sizeof(real));
...

// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L355
for (a = 0; a < vocab_size; a++)
        for (b = 0; b < layer1_size; b++) {
            next_random = next_random * (unsigned long long)25214903917 + 11;
            syn0[a * layer1_size + b] =
                (((next_random & 0xFFFF) / (real)65536) - 0.5) / layer1_size;
        }
```


- `syn1neg` is a global variable that is zero-initialized. It has dimensions
  `VOCAB x HIDDEN`. This layer also holds hidden representations of word vectors,
  _when they are used as a negative sample_.

```cpp
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L350
a = posix_memalign((void **)&syn1neg, 128,
                   (long long)vocab_size * layer1_size * sizeof(real));
...
for (a = 0; a < vocab_size; a++)
    for (b = 0; b < layer1_size; b++) syn1neg[a * layer1_size + b] = 0;
```

- `neu1e` is a temporary per-thread buffer (Remember that the `word2vec` C code
  use CPU threads for parallelism) which is zero initialized. It has dimensions
  `1 x HIDDEN`.

```cpp
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L370
real *neu1e = (real *)calloc(layer1_size, sizeof(real));
```

#### Backpropogation

Throughout `word2vec`, no 2D arrays are used. Indexing of the form
`arr[word][ix]` is manually written as `arr[word * layer1_size + ix]`. So, I
will call `word * layer1_size` as the "base address", and `ix` as the "offset
of the array index expression henceforth.

Here, `l1` is the base address of the word at the center of window (the focus
word).  `l2` is the base address of either the word that is negative sampled
from the corpus, or the word that is a positive sample from within the context
window.

`label` tells us whether the sample is a positive or a negative sample.
`label = 1` for positive samples, and `label = 0` for negative samples.

```cpp
// zero initialize neu1e
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L419
for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) neu1e[c] = 0;
...
// loop through each negative sample
// https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L508
if (negative > 0)  for (d = 0; d < negative + 1; d++) {
  ...
  // https://github.com/imsky/word2vec/blob/master/word2vec.c#L521
  // take the dot product: f=  syn0[focus] . syn1neg[context]
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) f += syn0[c + l1] * syn1neg[c + l2];

  // compute: g = (label - sigmoid(2f - 1)) * alpha
  // g is computed using lookups into a lookup table and clamping for
  // efficiency.
  if (f > MAX_EXP) g = (label - 1) * alpha;
  else if (f < -MAX_EXP) g = (label - 0) * alpha;
  else
  g = (label - expTable[(int)((f + MAX_EXP) *
                              (EXP_TABLE_SIZE /
                               MAX_EXP / 2))]) * alpha;
  // Now that we have computed the gradient:
  // `g = (label - output) * learningrate`,
  // we need to perform backprop. This is where the code gets weird.

  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) neu1e[c] += g * syn1neg[c + l2];
  for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) syn1neg[c + l2] += g * syn0[c + l1];
  } // end loop through negative samples
// Learn weights input -> hidden
for (c = 0; c < layer1_size; c++) syn0[c + l1] += neu1e[c];
```

- We have _two_ vectors for each word, one called `syn0[l1 + _]` and
  the other `syn1neg[l2 + _]`. The `syn1neg` word embedding is used whenever
  a word is used a negative sample, and is not used anywhere else. Also,
  the `syn1neg` vector is zero initialized, while the `syn0` vectors are
  randomly initialized.

- The values we backprop with `g * syn1neg[l2 + _]`, `g * syn0[l1 + _]` are
  _not_ the correct gradients of the error term! The derivative of a sigmoid
  is `dsigmoid(x)/dx = sigmoid(x) [1 - sigmoid(x)]`. The `[1 - sigmoid(x)]`
  is nowhere to be seen, let alone the fact that we are using
  `sigmoid(2x - 1)` and not regular sigmoid. Very weird.

- We hold the value of `syn0` constant throughout all the negative samples,
  which was not mentioned in any tutorial I've read.

The paper does not mentioned these implementation details, and neither
does _any blog post that I've read_. I don't understand what's going on,
and I plan on updating this section when I understand this better.

## [How does one work with arrays in a linear language?](#how-does-one-work-with-arrays-in-a-linear-language)

Given an array of qubits `xs: Qubit[]`, I want to switch to little endian.
Due to no-cloning, I can't copy them! I suppose I can use recursion to build
up a new "list". But this is not the efficient array version we know and love
and want.

The code that I want to work but does not:
```csharp
function switchEndian(xs: Qubit[]): Unit {
    for(i in 0..Length(xs) - 1) {
        Qubit q = xs[i]; // boom, this does not work!
        xs[i] = xs[Length(xs) - 1 - i]
        xs[Length(xs) - 1 - i] = q;
    }
}
```

On the other hand, what _does work_ is to setup a quantum circuit that
performs this flipping, since it's a permutation matrix at the end of
the day. But this is very slow, since it needs to simulate the "quantumness"
of the solution, since it takes `2^n` basis vectors for `n` qubits.

However, the usual recursion based solution works:
```csharp
function switchEndian(xs: Qubit[]): Qubit[] {
    if(Length(xs) == 1) {
        return xs;
    } else {
        switchEndian(xs[1..(Length(xs) - 1)] + xs[0]
    }
}
```

This is of course, suboptimal.

I find it interesting that in the linear types world, often the "pure" solution
is _forced_ since mutation very often involves temporaries / copying!

(I'm solving assignments in [qsharp](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/)
for my course in college)

## [Linear optimisation is the same as linear feasibility checking](#linear-optimisation-is-the-same-as-linear-feasibility-checking)
Core building block of effectively using the ellipsoid algorithm.

- If we posess a way to check if a point $p \in P$ where $P$ is a polytope, we
  can use this to solve optimisation problems.
- Given the optimisation problem maximise $c^Tx$ subject to $Ax = b$, we can
  construct a new _non-emptiness_ problem. This allows us to convert optimisation
  into _feasibility_.
- The new problem is $Ax = b, A^Ty = c, c^Tx = b^T y$. Note that by duality,
  a point in this new polyhedra will _be an optimal solution to the above linear program_.
  We are forcing $c^Tx = b^Ty$, which will be the optimal solution, since the
  solution where the primal and dual agree is the optimal solution by strong
  duality.
- This way, we have converted a _linear programming_ problem into a
  _check if this polytope is empty_ problem!

## [Quantum computation without complex numbers](#quantum-computation-without-complex-numbers)

I recently learnt that the Toeffili and Hadamard gates are universal for
quantum computation. The description of these gates involve no complex numbers.
So, we can write any quantum circuit in a "complex number free" form. The caveat
is that we may very well have _input qubits_ that require complex numbers.


Even so, a large number (all?) of the basic algorithms shown in Nielsen and
Chaung can be encoded in an entirely complex-number free fashion.

I don't really understand the ramifications of this, since I had the intuition
that the power of quantum computation comes from the ability to express
complex phases along with superposition (tensoring). However, I now have
to remove the power from going from R to C in many cases. This is definitely
something to ponder.

# [Big list of emacs gripes](#big-list-of-emacs-gripes)

#### `markdown-mode` lags when I open a paren `[for a link`.

I suppose this is because
it's attempting to match it, and is unable to figure out
what to match to. I now edit markdown in `text-mode`.

#### `ctrl-backspace`/`backward-kill-word` kills far too much.

- [reference `emacs.se`](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/30401/backward-kill-word-kills-too-much-how-to-make-it-more-intelligent)

The answer seems to be:
yes, it kills a word. You can redefine what a word is,
and break lots of other stuff in the process, or redefine
what `ctrl-backspace` does. However, as a non-expert, it's hard
to say what redefining this will mean. Will it still interact
with history the same way?


#### there is no centralized notion of `C-o` (go back to where I came from).

- [reference `emacs.se`](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/9908/can-cursor-jump-back-to-the-previous-position)
- [reference `stackoverflow`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4918707/in-emacs-how-to-go-back-to-previous-line-position-after-using-semantic-jump-to)

Instead, it differentiates between "go back in buffer" versus
"go back across buffers".

This is extremely confusing when one is attempting to read
code and understand control-flow: I want a _unified_ way
to say "go forward in my history; OK go back" when I am
exploring code. I don't *want* to keep track of whether
I came to this buffer from the same buffer or another buffer.
The fact that emacs needs this is moronic.

#### Scrolling half a page is broken

- [reference `emacs.se`](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/27698/how-can-i-scroll-a-half-page-on-c-v-and-m-v)
- [reference `emacswiki`](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/HalfScrolling)

There is no inbuilt functionality to scroll half a page. The canonical 
reference points to this:

```lisp
(autoload 'View-scroll-half-page-forward "view")
(autoload 'View-scroll-half-page-backward "view")
(global-set-key (kbd "C-d") 'View-scroll-half-page-forward)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-u") 'View-scroll-half-page-backward)
```

However, this does not work well. On press `C-u` to go to
the top of the file, it does not move the cursor to the
top completely; once  _the first line is in view_
(with my cursor still on line 30),
emacs obstinately refuses to scroll up with a 'beginning of buffer'
message. I'm sure there's more `elisp` I can write to fix this,
but the fact that something like moving-half-a-page
is rocket science just rubs me the wrong way.

This code that is given in `emacswiki` also
has the exact same issue, I don't understand
how the poster says they come from vim and
did not notice this inconsistency.

```lisp
(defun zz-scroll-half-page (direction)
  "Scrolls half page up if `direction' is non-nil, otherwise will scroll half page down."
  (let ((opos (cdr (nth 6 (posn-at-point)))))

    (move-to-window-line nil)  ;; Move cursor to middle line

#### Default encoding is weird: `chinese-iso-8bit`

- [`emacs.se reference`](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/34322/set-default-coding-system-utf-8)

Why in the world is this the option that shows up by default?
There are so many better options, with `utf-8` being the
sanest of them all; this is a nice spherical cow of
the problems with emacs: too much stuff, too like sanity.

The spell is:

```
(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
```

##### linum lags on large files

#### Books about charming sentences and how to construct them

#### Active v/s passive vocabulary

- passive vocabulary: Words one knows and can understand from context.
- active vocabulary: Words one uses actively while speaking.

The key to good writing for those who read a lot is to expand their
active vocabulary to match their passive vocabulary.

- A useful exercise is to look for synonyms during speech; This way,
  one forces an enlargening of active vocabulary. 

- Moulding one's inner mologoue to reach the ideal 'Voice' might also be
  benificial; However, there is a tendency that speech is not the same as
  writing --- very few people speak as they write. I wish to write like my idol
  (David Foster Wallace), who does speak like he writes. I surmise it's
  worthwhile to mould my inner speech to align with how my writing is supposed
  to be.

#### Punctuation

Should one use punctuation, or shoud not? How much should one use punctuation?
What range of punctuation should one use --- from the common`,` and `.`, all the
way up to `:`, `;`, and `---`. 

There appear to be three distinct schools of thought. 

- The first school of thought is prescriptive;
  They hold the belief that one must use _as much_ punctuation as is necessary to 
  accurately transcribe cadence.

- The second school are the moderates. Too much of
  punctuation can leave writing stilted, or worse, give it an appearance of putting
  on a veneer of respectability. Use as much punctation as is necessary, they say.

- The third school of thought is anarchic and recommend no punctuation at all 
  except for `.` as this is a terrific way to get a sense for how to place words as one is forced to switch up vocabulary based on the cadence one wishes for instead of
  relying on artificial markers afforded by our system of writing.

#### English grammar

- [english club](https://www.englishclub.com/grammar/pronouns-relative.htm)
- [ginger software: grammar rules](https://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/)
- [Literary devices](https://literarydevices.net/)

I couldn't really find a good "grammar book", so I decided
to simply poll friends every time I came across a word that I 
didn't know. Assumes knowledge of `noun`, `pronoun`,
`verb`, `adjective`.


#### Pronoun resolution

- cataphora: later reference, anaphora: past reference?

The connection between this and `catamorphism`/`anamorphism`
is something I wish to explore.

- `let ([x 5]) (+ x 3))`: `x` is anaphora resolution.

# [Big list of Architecture](#big-list-of-architecture) 

I have an interest in architecture and how it might relate to software.
While the two are quite different, I feel that a deep look at both could
be useful for both discplines. I think my favourite building to date
has been [fallingwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallingwater). Here are
things on architecture I wish to read and/or have read:

- The way buildings learn.
- The sciences of the artifical.
- The timeless way of building.
- Eisenman
- [Why you hate contemporary architecture](https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/10/why-you-hate-contemporary-architecture): 
  An article that provides points of view and a broad set of link on further
  reading to how architecture reached the 'contemporary', almost
  'uncomfortable' style it has today. Some choice quotes:

> There was a good reason why, historically, religious architecture has been
> the most concerned with beauty for beauty’s sake; the more time is spent
> elegantly decorating a cathedral, the more it serves its intended function of
> celebrating God’s glory, whereas the more time is spent decorating an office
> building, the less money will be left over for the developer.

# [Big list of Recipes](#big-list-of-recipes) 


#### Upma

- start with ghee, sesame seeds, curry leaves, red + green chili, ginger garlic
  paste, hing (asaefodita).
- finely chopped onion, allow this to caramelize.
- A dash of turmeric for depth.
- Add in the rava, allow it to cook/heat.
- Add in tomato and a little water when it's done heating. Allow tomato to cook.
- Add in more water, cover with a lid, and let it come to a boil. Keep stirring
  to prevent clumps.
- Garnish with coriander.

#### General Coconut based thickening agent


- A few methi seeds (pungent, deep scent)
- some coriander seeds (mild herbal scent) 
- Chopped up red chilis (heat, spice, color)
- Chopped up green chilis (spice)
- Chopped up green chilis (spice)
- Chopped up garlic (some; strong, garlicky flavour and scent)

Heat the spices with oil to create a fragrant mix (Tadka[Hindi] / Oggarane[Kannada]).


- Grated coconut
- Salt (to taste)

Finally, throw in the above heated spices into the blender along with the
grated coconut and blend all of it. It turns into a thick red paste.


#### Breadfruit Sambhar


- Heat up oil.
- Fry **sesame seeds, cumin seeds, curry leaves, a tiny cinnamon stick** first. 
- Once fried, add in **garlic** to taste. 
- After garlic has fried as well, saute **onions** till golden. 
- Finely chop **tomatoes** and add it to the sauteed onions. Cover with a lid
- till the tomatoes release all their water.
- Now that we have a solid flavour base, pour in water to cook the breadfruit.
- Add in the **chopped breadfruit** --- chop the breadfruit in thin slices
- along the center; the center has interesting texture we wish to maximize. 
- Add in the **[General coconut based thickening agent](#general-coconut-based-thickening-agent)**.
- Also add salt to taste.
- Cover with a lid. Allow breadfruit, water, and thickening agent to come to a boil.
- Lower flame to low. Allow breadfruit to soften and cook.
- Once breadfruit is cooked, pour in **coconut milk**. Continue cooking for
  ten minutes.

##### decephalized

We need to clone decephalized humans and livestock.
With thousands of brainless bodies kept alive on life support, you have test
subjects for a limitless number of experiments that would have never been
possible before. You also create a never-ending O negative blood supply and
organ harvesting program.
It the case of decephalized animals, you also get cruelty free meat. And that's
how you bootstrap the program and port it to the human model.

##### demagoguery

The ancient Greeks had a word for our modern systems “demagoguery” which
equates to charismatic liars manipulating gullible people to vote against their
