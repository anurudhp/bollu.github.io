<ul><li><span class='centered'> I use Bayesian statistics constantly for probabilistic programming and neural
  networks. Calculus gave me access to understand automatic differentiation,
  which gets used in everything I do. Real analysis doesn't come up often, but
  intermediate value thm. style arguments are handy.
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> I don't use classic geometry, but I when I was doing graphics I used projective
  geometry, and that served as a gateway to understand category theory's duality
  principle, and I use category theory to organize most of the code I write.
  </li><li><span class='centered'> I took one course on differential geometry. The knowledge I gained from it
  probably led to about half of my income to date. I've made a career out of
  weaponizing "obscure" math, e.g. using toric varieties of rational functions of
  Zhegalkin polynomials to schedule instructions...
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Differential equations? Physics? Well, I use Hamiltonian methods for most of
  the sampling I do in the world of probabilistic programming. So understanding
  symplectic integrators is a big step, and I have to move frictionless particles
  subject to a Hamiltonian, so there's diff eq.
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Fourier analysis, heat equations? Well, if I want to approximate a
  space/distribution, http://ddg.math.uni-goettingen.de/pub/GeodesicsInHeat.pdf
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Learning group theory "bottom up" from monoids and the like has been useful,
  because I use monoids basically everywhere as a functional programmer to
  aggregate data. It led to the work I did at S&P Capital IQ, and later to
  basically my entire niche as a functional programmer.
  </li><li><span class='centered'> But understanding more of the surrounding landscape has been useful as well, as
  I use all sorts of lattices and order theory when working with propagators. And
  I use regular and inverse semigroups (note, not groups!) when working with all
  sorts of fast parsing techniques.
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Complex analysis? Understanding Moebius transformations means I can understand
  how continued fractions work, which leads to models for computable reals that
  don't waste computation and are optimally lazy. Knowing analytic functions lets
  me understand complex step differentiation.
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Linear algebra is in everything I've done since highschool. Learning a bit of
  geometric algebra, and playing around with Plucker coordinates led to me
  licensing tech to old game companies for computational visibility back before
  it was a "solved" problem.
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Wandering back a bit, Gröbner bases wind up being useful for comparing circuits
  modulo 'don't care' bits for impossible situations, and all sorts of other
  simplification tasks.
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Let's go obscure. Pade approximants? Good rational approximations, not
  polynomial ones. Sounds academic, but computing exp and log is expensive, and
  fast rational approximations can be conservative, monotone and have nice
  derivatives, speeding NN-like designs a lot.
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Weird number systems => Data structures.  Category theory acts as a rosetta
  stone for so many other areas of math it isn't even funny. You can understand
  almost all of the essential bits of quantum computing just knowing by category
  theory.
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> Logic. Well, which logic? You run into a modal logic in a philosophy class
  some time and think of it as a clever hack, but monads in FP are basically a
  modality. Modal logics for necessity/possibility model effect systems well.
  Substructural logics to manage resource usage...
  
  
  </li><li><span class='centered'> I don't use a lot of number theory. There. Mind you, this is also one of those
  areas where I'm just standing on weak foundations, so I don't know what I
  don't know. I just know it's hard to do all sorts of things that sound easy
  and try to muddle through w/ my limited background.</li></ul>
