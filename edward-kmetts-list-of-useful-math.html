I use Bayesian statistics constantly for probabilistic programming and neural
networks. Calculus gave me access to understand automatic differentiation,
which gets used in everything I do. Real analysis doesn't come up often, but
intermediate value thm. style arguments are handy.
I don't use classic geometry, but I when I was doing graphics I used projective
geometry, and that served as a gateway to understand category theory's duality
principle, and I use category theory to organize most of the code I write.
I took one course on differential geometry. The knowledge I gained from it
probably led to about half of my income to date. I've made a career out of
weaponizing "obscure" math, e.g. using toric varieties of rational functions of
Zhegalkin polynomials to schedule instructions...
Differential equations? Physics? Well, I use Hamiltonian methods for most of
the sampling I do in the world of probabilistic programming. So understanding
symplectic integrators is a big step, and I have to move frictionless particles
subject to a Hamiltonian, so there's diff eq.
Fourier analysis, heat equations? Well, if I want to approximate a
space/distribution, http://ddg.math.uni-goettingen.de/pub/GeodesicsInHeat.pdf
Learning group theory "bottom up" from monoids and the like has been useful,
because I use monoids basically everywhere as a functional programmer to
aggregate data. It led to the work I did at S&P Capital IQ, and later to
basically my entire niche as a functional programmer.
But understanding more of the surrounding landscape has been useful as well, as
I use all sorts of lattices and order theory when working with propagators. And
I use regular and inverse semigroups (note, not groups!) when working with all
sorts of fast parsing techniques.
Complex analysis? Understanding Moebius transformations means I can understand
how continued fractions work, which leads to models for computable reals that
don't waste computation and are optimally lazy. Knowing analytic functions lets
me understand complex step differentiation.
Linear algebra is in everything I've done since highschool. Learning a bit of
geometric algebra, and playing around with Plucker coordinates led to me
licensing tech to old game companies for computational visibility back before
it was a "solved" problem.
Wandering back a bit, Gröbner bases wind up being useful for comparing circuits
modulo 'don't care' bits for impossible situations, and all sorts of other
simplification tasks.
Let's go obscure. Pade approximants? Good rational approximations, not
polynomial ones. Sounds academic, but computing exp and log is expensive, and
fast rational approximations can be conservative, monotone and have nice
derivatives, speeding NN-like designs a lot.
Weird number systems => Data structures.  Category theory acts as a rosetta
stone for so many other areas of math it isn't even funny. You can understand
almost all of the essential bits of quantum computing just knowing by category
theory.
Logic. Well, which logic? You run into a modal logic in a philosophy class
some time and think of it as a clever hack, but monads in FP are basically a
modality. Modal logics for necessity/possibility model effect systems well.
Substructural logics to manage resource usage...
I don't use a lot of number theory. There. Mind you, this is also one of those
areas where I'm just standing on weak foundations, so I don't know what I
don't know. I just know it's hard to do all sorts of things that sound easy
and try to muddle through w/ my limited background.
