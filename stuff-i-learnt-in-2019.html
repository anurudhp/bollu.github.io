I write these retrospective blog posts every year since 2017. I tend to post a
collection of papers, books, and ideas I've stumbled across that year.
Unfortunately, this year, the paper list will be sparser, since I lost some
data along the way to the year, and hence I don't have links to everything I
read. So this is going to be a sparser list, consisting of things that I found
<i><span class='centered'>memorable</i>.
I also re-organised my website, letting the link die, since keeping it up was
taking far too many cycles (In particular, CertBot was far too annoying to
maintain, and the feedback of hugo was also very annoying). I now have a
<i><span class='centered'>single</i> file, the
<a href=https://github.com/bollu/bollu.github.io><span class='centered'><code>README.md</code>of the <code>bollu/bollu.github.io</code></a>
repo,
to which I add notes on things I find interesting. I've bound the <code>i</code> alias
(for idea) on all my shells everywhere, to open the <code>README.md</code> file, wait
for me to write to it, run a <code>git commit</code> so I can type out a commit, and
then push. This has been <i><span class='centered'>massive</i> for what I manage to write down: I feel
like I've managed to write down a lot of one-liners / small facts that I've
picked up which I would not otherwise. I'm attempting to similarly pare down
other friction-inducing parts of my workflow. Suggestions here would be very
welcome!
If there's a theme of the year (insofar as my scattered reading has a
theme...), it's "lattices and geometry". Geometry in terms of differential
geometry, topology, and topoi. Lattices in the sense of a bunch of abstract
interpretation and semantics.
<h4><a id=course-work-optimisation-theory-quantum-computation-statistics href='#course-work-optimisation-theory-quantum-computation-statistics'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Course work: optimisation theory, quantum computation, statistics</h4>
My course work was less interesting to me this time, due to the fact that I had
chosen to study some wild stuff earlier on, and now have to take reasonable stuff
to graduate. However, there were courses that filled in a lot of gaps in my
self-taught knowledge for me, and the ones I listed were the top ones in that
regard.
I wound up reading
<a href=https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/><span class='centered'>Boyd on optimisation theory</a>,
<a href=http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf><span class='centered'>Nielsen and Chuang</a> for quantum computation,
where I also
<a href=https://github.com/bollu/quantum-course-exercises><span class='centered'>solved a bunch of exercises in Q#</a>
which was very fun and rewarding. I'm beginning to feel that learning quantum
computation is the right route to grokking things like entanglement and
superposition, unlike the physics which is first of all much harder due to
infinite dimensionality, and less accessible since we can't <i><span class='centered'>program</i> it.
<h4><a id=formal-research-work-compilers-formal-verification-programming-languages href='#formal-research-work-compilers-formal-verification-programming-languages'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Formal research work: Compilers, Formal verification, Programming languages</h4>
My research work is on the above topics, so I try to stay abreast of what's
going on in the field. What I've read over the past year on these topics is:
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://popl19.sigplan.org/details/POPL-2019-Research-Papers/71/A-2-I-Abstract-2-Interpretation><span class='centered'><code>A^2I</code>: meta-abstract interpretation</a>.
  This paper extends the theory of abstract interpretation to perform abstract
  interpretation on program analyses themselves. I'm not sure how <i><span class='centered'>useful</i> this
  is going to be, as I still hold on to the belief that AI as a framework is
  too general to allow one to prove complex results. But I am still interested
  in trying to adapt this to some problems I have at hand. Perhaps it's going
  to work.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3341691><span class='centered'>Cubicial Agda</a>. This paper introduces
  cubical type theory and its implementation in Agda. It appears to solve many
  problems that I had struggled with during my formalization of loop
  optimisations: In particular, dealing with Coinductive types in Coq, and that
  of defining quotient types / setoids. Supposedly, cubical Agda makes dealing
  with Coinduction far easier. It allows allows the creation of "real" quotient
  types that respect equality, without having to deal with <code>setoid</code> style
  objects that make for large Gallina terms. I don't fully understand how the
  <i><span class='centered'>theory</i> works: In particular, as far as I can tell, the synthetic interval
  type <code>I</code> allows one to only access the start and end points (<code>0</code> and <code>1</code>),
  but not anything in between, so I don't really see how it allows for
  interpolation.  I also don't understand how this allows us to make Univalence
  computable.  I feel I need to practice with this new technology before I'm
  well versed, but it's definitely a paper I'm going to read many, many times
  till I grok it.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05844><span class='centered'>Naive Cubical type theory</a>. This paper
  promises a way to perform informal reasoning with cubical type theory, the
  way we are able to do so with, say, a polymorphic type theory for lambda
  calculus. The section names such as "how do we think of paths",
  "what can we do with paths", inspire confidence</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://icfp19.sigplan.org/details/icfp-2019-papers/26/Call-By-Need-is-Clairvoyant-Call-By-Value><span class='centered'>Call by need is Clairvoyant call by value</a>. This key insight is to notice that call by need
  is "just" call by value, when we evaluate only those values that are
  eventually forced, and throw away the rest. Thus, if we had an oracle that
  tells us which values are eventually forced, we can convert call by need into
  call by value, relative to this oracle. This cleans up many proofs in the
  literature, and might make it far more intuitive to teach call by need to
  people as well. Slick paper, I personally really enjoyed reading this.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10228><span class='centered'>Shift/Reset the Penultimate Backpropagator</a>
  This paper describes how to implement backprop using delimited continuations.
  Also, supposedly, using staging / building a compiler out of this paradigm
  allows one to write high performance compilers for backprop without having
  to suffer, which is always nice.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~zkincaid/pub/popl19a.pdf><span class='centered'>Closed forms for numerical loops</a>
  This paper introduces a new algebra of polynomials with exponentials. It then
  studies the eigenvalues of the matrix that describes the loop, and tries to
  find closed forms in terms of polynomials and exponentials. They choose
  to only work with rationals, but not extensions of rational numbers
  (in terms of field extensions of the rationals). Supposedly, this is easier
  to implement and reason about. Once again, this is a paper I'd like to
  reimplement to understand fully, but the paper is well-done!</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://engineering.purdue.edu/Papers/Sundararajah.pdf><span class='centered'>Composable, sound transformations of Nested recursion and loops</a>.
  This paper attempts to bring ideas from polyhedral compilation
  into working with nested recursion. They create a representation using
  multitape finite automata, using which they provide a representation for
  nested recursion. I was somewhat disappointed that it does not handle
  mutual recursion, since my current understanding is that one can always
  convert nested recursion into a "reasonable" straight line program by
  simply inlining calls and then re-using polyhedral techniques.</li></ul>

I really enjoyed my time at Tweag! It was fun, and
<a href=https://github.com/TerrorJack><span class='centered'>Shao Cheng</a>
was a great mentor. I must admit that I was somewhat distracted, by all the new
and shiny things I was learning thanks to all the cool people there <code>:)</code> In
particular, I wound up bugging
<a href=http://assert-false.net/arnaud/><span class='centered'>Arnaud Spiwack</a>,
<a href=http://simeon-carstens.com/><span class='centered'>Simeon Carstens</a>,
and <a href=https://github.com/mmesch><span class='centered'>Matthias Meschede</a>
quite a bit, about type theory, MCMC sampling, and signal processing of storm
clouds.
I wound up reading a decent chunk of GHC source code, and while I can't link
to specifics here, I understood a lot of the RTS much better than I did before.
It was an enlightening experience, to say the least, and being paid to hack on
a GHC backend was a really fun way to spend the summer.
It also led me to fun discoveries, such as
<a href=https://github.com/ghc/ghc/blob/535a26c90f458801aeb1e941a3f541200d171e8f/compiler/cmm/Debug.hs#L458><span class='centered'>how does one debug debug info?</a>
I also really loved Paris as a city. My AirBnb host was a charming artist who
suggest spots for me around the city, which I really appreciated. Getting
around was disorienting for the first week or so, due to the fact that I could
not (and still do not) really understand how to decide in which direction to
walk inside the subways to find a particular line 
<i><span class='centered'>going in a particular direction</i>.
The city has some great spots for quiet work, though! In particular, the
<a href=https://www.anticafe.eu/lieux/louvre-paris-75001/><span class='centered'>Louvre Anticafe</a>
was a really nice place to hang out and grab coffee. The model is great: you
pay for hours spent at the Anticafe, with coffee and snacks free. They also
had a discount for students which I gratefully used.
I bumped into interesting artists, programmers, and students who were open for
conversation there. I highly recommend hanging out there.
<h4><a id=probabilistic-programming-giving-a-talk-at-functionalconf href='#probabilistic-programming-giving-a-talk-at-functionalconf'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Probabilistic programming & giving a talk at FunctionalConf</h4>
This was the first talk I'd ever given, and it was on probabilistic programming
in haskell. In particular, I explained the
<a href=https://github.com/adscib/monad-bayes><span class='centered'><code>monad-bayes</code></a> approach of
doing this, and why this was profitable.
<a href=https://github.com/bollu/functionalconf-2019-slides-probabilistic-programming/blob/master/slides.pdf><span class='centered'>The slides are available here</a>.
It was a fun experience giving a talk, and I'd like to do more of it, since I
got a lot out of attempting to explain the ideas to people. I wish I had more
time, and had a clearer idea of who the audience was. I got quite a bit of
help from <a href=https://www.snoyman.com/><span class='centered'>Michael Snoyman</a> to whip the talk into
shape, which I greatly appreciated.
The major ideas of probabilistic programming as I described it are
from Adam Scibior's thesis:
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~ascibior/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf><span class='centered'>Adam Scibior: Formally justified and modular Bayesian inference for probabilistic programs</a></li></ul>
Along the way, I and others at tweag read the other major papers in the space,
including:
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.3255><span class='centered'>Church, a language for generative models</a>,
  which is nice since it describes it's semantics in terms of sampling. This is
  unlike Adam's thesis, where they define the denotational semantics in terms
  of measure theory, which is then approximated by sampling.</li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/16c5/06c5bb253f7528ddcc80c72673fabf584f32.pdf><span class='centered'>Riemann Manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</a>
  which describes how to perform Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on the 
  <i><span class='centered'>information geometry</i> manifold.  So, for example, if we are trying to sample 
  from gaussians, we sample from a 2D Riemannian manifold with parameters mean 
  and varince, and metric as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_information_metric><span class='centered'>Fisher information metric</a>.
  This is philosophically the "correct" manifold to sample from, since it
  represents the intrinsic geometry of the space we want to sample from.</li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08271.pdf><span class='centered'>An elementary introduction to Information geometry by Frank Nielsen</a>
  something I stumbled onto as I continued reading about sampling from
  distributions. The above description about the "correct" manifold for
  gaussians comes from this branch of math, but generalises it quite a bit
  further. I've tried to reread it several times as I gradually gained maturity
  in differential geometry. I can't say I understand it just yet, but I hope to
  do so in a couple of months. I need more time for sure to meditate on the
  objects.</li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://github.com/bollu/shakuni><span class='centered'>Reimplementation of <code>monad-bayes</code></a>.
  This repo holds the original implementation on which the talk is based on.
  I read through the <code>monad-bayes</code> source code, and then re-implemented the
  bits I found interesting. It was a nice exercise, and you can see
  the git history tell a tale of my numerous mis-understandings of MCMC methods,
  till I finally got what the hell was going on.</li></ul>
<h4><a id=presburger-arithmetic href='#presburger-arithmetic'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Presburger Arithmetic</h4>
Since we use a bunch of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presburger_arithmetic><span class='centered'>presburger arithmetic</a>
for <a href=http://polyhedral.info/><span class='centered'>polyhedral compilation</a>
which is a large research interest of mine, I've been trying to build a
"complete" understanding of this space. So this time, I wanted to learn
how to build good solvers:
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://github.com/bollu/gutenberger><span class='centered'><code>bollu/gutenberger</code></a> is a decision
  procedure for Presburger arithmetic that exploits their encoding as finite
  automata. One thing that I was experimenting with was that we only use
  numbers of finite bit-width, so we can explore the entire state space
  of the automata and then perform NFA reduction using
  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFA_minimization><span class='centered'>DFA minimisation</a>. The
  reference I used for this was the excellent textbook
  <a href=https://www7.in.tum.de/~esparza/autoskript.pdf><span class='centered'>Automata theory: An algorithmic approach, Chapter 10</a></li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=http://www.lsv.fr/~haase/documents/ch16.pdf><span class='centered'>The taming of the semi-linear set</a>
  This uses a different encoding of presburger sets, which allows them to bound
  a different quantity (the norm) rather than the bitwidth descriptions. This allows
  them to compute <i><span class='centered'>exponentially</i> better bounds for some operations than
  were known before, which is quite cool. This is a paper I keep trying to
  read and failing due to density. I should really find a week away from civilization
  to just plonk down and meditate upon this.</li></ul>
<h4><a id=open-questions-for-which-i-want-answers href='#open-questions-for-which-i-want-answers'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Open questions for which I want answers</h4>
I want better references to being able to <i><span class='centered'>regenerate</i> the inequalities
description from a given automata which accepts the presburger set automata.
This will allow one to smoothly switch between the <i><span class='centered'>geometric</i> description
and the <i><span class='centered'>algebraic</i> description. There are some operations that only work
well on the geometry (such as optimisation), and others that only work well on
the algebraic description (such as state-space minimisation). I have not found
any good results for this, only scattered fragments of partial results.
If nothing else, I would like some kind of intuition for <i><span class='centered'>why this is hard</i>.
Having tried my stab at it, the general impression that I have is that the
space of automata is much larger than the things that can be encoded as
presburger sets. Indeed, it was shown that automata accept numbers which
are ultimately periodic.
<ul><li><span class='centered'>  first order logic + "arithmetic with +" + (<i><span class='centered'>another operation I cannot recall</i>).
   I'm going to fill this in once I re-find the reference.</li></ul>
But yes, it's known that automata accept a language that's broader than just
first order logic + "arithmetic with +", which means it's hard to dis-entangle
the presburger gits from the non-presburger bits of the automata.
<h4><a id=prolog href='#prolog'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Prolog</h4>
I wanted to get a better understading of how prolog works under the hood, so I began
re-implementing the <a href=http://wambook.sourceforge.net/><span class='centered'>WAM: warren abstract machine</a>.
It's really weird, this is the <i><span class='centered'>only stable reference</i> I can find to implementing
high-performance prolog interpreters. I don't really understand how to chase the
paper-trail in this space, I'd greatly appreciate references. My implementation
is at <a href=https://github.com/bollu/warren-cpp/><span class='centered'><code>bollu/warren-cpp</code></a>. Unfortunately,
I had to give up due to a really hard-to-debug bug.
It's crazy to debug this abstract machine, since the internal representation gets
<i><span class='centered'>super convoluted</i> and hard to track, due to the kind of optimised encoding it
uses on the heap.
If anyone has a better/cleaner design for implementing good prologs, I'd love
to know.
Another fun paper I found in this space thanks to Edward Kmett was
<a href=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/the-rete-matching-algorithm/184405218><span class='centered'>the Rete matching algorithm</a>,
which allows one to declare many many pattern matches, which are then "fused"
together into an optimal matcher that tries to reuse work across failed
matchers.
<h4><a id=general-relativity href='#general-relativity'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> General Relativity</h4>
This was on my "list of things I want to understand before I die", so I wound
up taking up an Independent Study in university, which basically means that
I study something on my own, and visit a professor once every couple weeks,
and am graded at the end of the term. For GR, I wound up referencing a wide
variety of sources, as well as a bunch of pure math diffgeo books. I've read
everything referenced to various levels. I feel I did take away the core
ideas of differential and Riemannian geometry. I'm much less sure I've grokked
general relativity, but I can at least read the equations and I know all the
terms, so that's something.
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/general-relativity/2012/fall><span class='centered'>The theoretical minimum by Leonard Susskind</a>.
  The lectures are breezy in style, building up the minimal theory (and no proofs)
  for the math, and a bunch of lectures spent analysing the physics. While I wish
  it were a little more proof heavy, it was a really great reference to learn the
  basic theory! I definitely recommend following this and then reading other
  books to fill in the gaps.</li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation_(book><span class='centered'>Gravitation by Misner Thorne and Wheeler</a>)
  This is an imposing book. I first read through the entire thing (Well, the parts I thought I needed),
  to be able to get a vague sense of what they're going for. They're rigorous in
  a very curious way: It has a bunch of great <i><span class='centered'>physics</i> perspectives of looking
  at things, and that was invaluable to me. Their view of forms as "slot machines"
  is also fun. In general, I found myself repeatedly consulting this book for
  the "true physical" meaning of a thing, such as curvature, parallel transport,
  the equation of a geodesic, and whatnot.</li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=http://www2.ing.unipi.it/griff/files/dC.pdf><span class='centered'>Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces by do Carmo</a>
  This is the best book to intro differential geometry I found. It throws away
  all of the high powered definitions that "modern" treatments offer, and
  starts from the ground up, building up the theory in 2D and 3D. This is amazing,
  since it gives you small, computable examples for things like
  "the Jacobian represents how tangents on a surface are transformed locally".</li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXGTevGJ01o&list=PLDfPUNusx1EoVnrQcCRishydtNBYU6A0c><span class='centered'>Symplectic geometry & classical mechanics by Tobias Osborne</a>
  This lecture series was great, since it re-did a lot of the math I'd seen
  in a more physicist style, especially around vector fields, flows, and
  Lie brackets. Unfortunately for me, I never even <i><span class='centered'>got</i> to the classical
  mechanics part by the time the semester ended. I began

  So it gets to the physically important bits (metrics, covariant derivatives)
  far later, so I mostly used it as a reference for problems and more rigour.</li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=http://hermes.ffn.ub.es/luisnavarro/nuevo_maletin/Einstein_GRelativity_1916.pdf><span class='centered'>Einstein's original paper introducing GR, translated</a>
  finally made it click as to <i><span class='centered'>why</i>
  he wanted to use tensor equations: tensor equations of the form <code>T = 0</code> are
  invariant in <i><span class='centered'>any coordinate system</i>, since on change of coordinates, <code>T</code>
  changes by a multiplicative factor! It's a small thing in hindsight, but it
  was nice to see it explicitly spelled out, since as I understand, no one
  among the physicists knew tensor calculus at the time, so he had to introduce
  all of it.</li></ul>
<h4><a id=discrete-differential-geometry href='#discrete-differential-geometry'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Discrete differential geometry</h4>
I can't recall how I ran across this: I think it was because I was trying to
get a better understanding of Cohomology, which led me to Google for
"computational differential geometry", that finally led me to Discrete
differential geometry.
It's a really nice collection of theories that show us how to discretize
differential geometry in low dimensions, leading to rich intuitions and
a myriad of applications for computer graphics.
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kmcrane/Projects/DDG/paper.pdf><span class='centered'>The textbook by Kennan Crane on the topic</a>
  which I read over the summer when I was stuck (more often than I'd like) in

  being linear algebra, which means one can calculate things on paper easily.
  That's such a blessing.</li><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.6216><span class='centered'>Geodesics in Heat</a>
  explores a really nice way to discover geodesics by simulating the heat

  equation as describing the evolution of particles that are performing random
  walks. Now, if we simulate this system for a short while and then look at the
  distribution, particles that reach a particular location on the graph 
  <i><span class='centered'>must have taken the shortest path</i>, since any longer path would not have 
  allowed particles to reach there. Thus, the distribution of particles at

  explores this analogy to find accurate geodesics on complex computational
  grids. This is aided by the use of differential geometry, appropriately

<h4><a id=synthetic-differential-geometry href='#synthetic-differential-geometry'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Synthetic differential geometry</h4>
It was <a href=http://assert-false.net/arnaud/><span class='centered'>Arnaud Spiwack</a>
who pointed me to this. It's a nice axiomatic
system of differential geometry, where we can use physicist style proofs of
"taking stuff upto order <code>dx</code>", and having everything work upto mathematical
rigor.
The TL;DR is that we want to add a new number called <code>dx</code> into the reals,
such that <code>dx^2 = 0</code>. But if such a number did exist, then clearly <code>dx = 0</code>.
However, the punchline is that to prove that <code>dx^2 = 0 => dx = 0</code> requires
the use of contradiction!
So, if we banish the law of excluded middle (and therefore no longer use
proof by contradiction), we are able to postulate the existence of a new
element <code>dx</code>, which obeys <code>dx^2 = 0</code>. Using this, we can build up the
whole theory of differential geometry in a pleasing way, without having to
go through the horror that is real analysis. (I am being hyperbolic, but really,
real analytic proofs are not pleasant).
<a href=https://www.github.com/bollu/diffgeo><span class='centered'>I began formalizing this in Coq and got a formalism going: <code>bollu/diffgeo</code></a>.
Once I was done with that, I realised I don't know how to exhibit <i><span class='centered'>models</i> of
the damn thing! So, reading up on that made me realise that I need around 8
chapters worth of a grad level textbook (the aptly named
<a href=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4757-4143-8><span class='centered'>Models of Smooth Infinitesimal Analysis</a>).
I was disheartened, so I <a href=https://mathoverflow.net/questions/346385/constructing-computable-synthetic-differential-geometry><span class='centered'>asked on <code>MathOverflow</code></a>
(also my first ever question there), where I learnt about tangent categories and
differential lambda calculus. Unfortunately, I don't have the bandwidth to read
another 150-page tome, so this has languished.
<h4><a id=optimisation-on-manifolds href='#optimisation-on-manifolds'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Optimisation on Manifolds</h4>
I began reading
<a href=http://www.eeci-institute.eu/GSC2011/Photos-EECI/EECI-GSC-2011-M5/book_AMS.pdf><span class='centered'>Absil: Optimisation on matrix manifolds</a>
which describes how to perform optimisation / gradient descent on
<i><span class='centered'>arbitrary Riemannian manifolds</i>, as well as closed forms for well-known
manifolds. The exposition in this book is really good, since it picks a
concrete manifold and churns out all the basic properties of it manually. The
only problem I had with the books was that there were quite a few gaps (?) in
the proofs -- perhaps I missed a bunch.
This led me to learn Lie theory to some degree, since that was the natural
setting for many of the proofs. I finally saw <i><span class='centered'>why</i> anyone gives a shit about
the tangent space at the identity: because it's <i><span class='centered'>easier to compute!</i> For a

to work on, and anything our hearts desired, really. I came away with new
branches of math I wanted to read, a better appreciation of the AI risk

explanations about sheaves and number theory that I was sorely lacking. All in
all, it was a great time, and I'd love to go back.

I wish to learn more about the p-adics and p-adic analysis, since they

Both of these describe a general method to transfer all topological ideas as
statements about <i><span class='centered'>computability</i> in a way that's far more natural (at least for
me, as a computer scientist). The notion of what a continuous function "should
be" (keeping inverse images of open sets open) arises naturally from this
computational viewpoint, and many proofs of topology amount to finding
functional programs that fit a certain type. It's a great read, and I feel gave

<h4><a id=philosophy href='#philosophy'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Philosophy</h4>
I've wanted to understand philosophy as a whole for a while now, at least
enough to get a general sense of what happened in each century. The last year,
I meandered through some philosophy of science, which led me to some really
wild ideas (such as that of
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemological_anarchism><span class='centered'>Paul Feyerabend's 'science as an anarchic enterprise'</a>
which I really enjoyed).
I also seem to get a lot more out of audio and video than text in general, so
I've been looking for podcasts and video lectures. I've been following:
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://historyofphilosophy.net/><span class='centered'>The history of philosophy without any gaps</a>
  for a detailed exposition on, say, the greeks, or the arabic philosophers.
  Unfortunately, this podcast focuses on far too much detail for me to have been
  able to use it as a way to get a broad idea about <i><span class='centered'>philosophy</i> in itself.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=http://philosophizethis.org/><span class='centered'>Philosophize This! by Stephen West</a>
  Is a good philosophy podcast for a <i><span class='centered'>broad</i> overview of different areas
  of Philosophy. I got a lot out of this, since I was able to get a sense
  of the progression of ideas in (Western) Philosophy. So I now know what
  <a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/><span class='centered'>Phenomenology</a> is,
  or what Foucault was reacting against.</li></ul>
I also attempted to read a bunch of philosophers, but the only ones I could
make a good dent on were the ones listed below. I struggled in writing this
section, since it's much harder to sanity check my understanding of philosophy,
versus mathematics, since there seems to be a range of interpretations of the
same philosophical work, and the general imprecise nature of language doesn't
help here at all. So please take all the descriptions below with some salt
to taste.
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish><span class='centered'>Discipline and Punish by Michel Foucault</a>
  Here, Foucault traces the history of the criminal justice system of society,
  and how it began as something performed 'on the body' (punishment),
  which was then expanded to a control 'of the mind' (reform). As usual,
  the perspective is fun, and I'm still going through the book.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madness_and_Civilization><span class='centered'>Madness and Civilization by Michel Foucault</a>
  which attempts to chronicle how our view of madness evolved as society did.
  It describes how madmen, who were on the edges of society, but still
  "respected" (for exmaple, considered as 'being touched by the gods') were
  pathologized by the Renaissance, and were seen as requiring treatment. I'm
  still reading it, but it's enjoyable so far, as a new perspective for me.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Value_of_Science><span class='centered'>The value of science by Henri Poincare</a>.
  Here, he defends the importance of experimentation, as well as the value of
  intuition to mathematics, along with the importance of what we consider
  formal logic. It's a tough read sometimes, but I think I got something out of
  it, at least in terms of perspective about science and mathematics.</li></ul>
<h4><a id=information-theory href='#information-theory'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Information theory</h4>
I've been on a quest to understand information theory far better than I
currently do. In general, I feel like this might be a much better way to
internalize probability theory, since it feels like it states probabilistic
objects in terms of "couting" / "optimisation of encodings", which is a
perspective I find far more natural.
Towards this aim, I wound up reading:
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html><span class='centered'>Information theory, Learning, and inference algorithms</a>
  This book attempts to provide the holistic view I was hoping for. It has
  great illustrations of the basic objects of information theory. However,
  I was hoping that the three topics would be more "unified" in the book,
  rather than being presented as three separate sections with some amount
  of back-and-forth-referencing among them. Even so, it was a really fun read.</li></ul>

This is a hardcore algebraic geometry textbook, and is arguably
<i><span class='centered'>great for studying sheaves</i> because of it. Sheaves are Chapter 2, and allows
one to see them be developed in their "true setting" as it were. In that
Grothendeick first invented sheaves for algebraic geometry, so it's good to
see them in the home they were born in. Once again, this is a book I lack
bandwidth for except to breezily read it as I go to bed. I did get something
out from doing this. I'm considering taking this book up as an independent
study, say the first four chapters. I'll need someone who knows algebraic
geometry to supervise me, though, which is hard to find in an institute geared
purely for computer science. (If anyone on the internet is kind enough to
volunteer some of their time to answer questions, I'll be very glad! Please

This section contains random assortments that I don't recall how I stumbled

that skimming such things gives me access to knowing about tools I would not

  and I'm getting a lot out of it, since it describes how to write down, say,

  I fell in love with geometric algebra, since it provides a really clean way
  to talk about <i><span class='centered'>all possible subspaces</i> of a given vector space. This provides
  super slick solutions to many geometry and linear algebra problems. The
  way I tend to look at it is that when one does linear algebra, there's a strict
  separation between "vectors" (which are elements of the vector space), and,
  say, "hyperplanes" (which are <i><span class='centered'>subspaces</i> of the vector space), as well as
  objects such as "rotations" (which are <i><span class='centered'>operators</i> on the vector space).
  Geometric algebra provides a rich enough <i><span class='centered'>instruction set</i> to throw all
  these three distinct things into a blender. This gives a really concise
  language to describe all phenomena that occurs in the vector space world ---
  which, let's be honest, is <i><span class='centered'>most</i> tractable phenomena! I had a blast

  This is definitely my favourite non-fiction book that I've read in 2019, hands
  down. The book gives a great account of the mathematical objects that went
  into Wiles' book of Fermat's last theorem. It starts with things like
  "what is a permutation" and ends at questions like "what's a reciprocity law"
  or "what's the absolute galois group". While at points, I do believe the book
  goes far too rapidly, all in all, it's a solid account of number theory
  that's distilled, but not in any way diluted. I really recommend reading this
  book if you have any interest in number theory (or, like me, a passing
  distaste due to a course on elementary number theory I took, with proofs that
  looked very unmotivated). This book made me decide that I should, indeed,
  definitely learn algebraic number theory, upto at least

  evolve and interact with alien races. It also poses some standard solutions
  to the Fermi Paradox, but it's done well. I felt that the fact that it was
  translated was painfully obvious in certain parts of the translation, which

  The book is set in a dystopian nightmare, where people are attempting to

  a post-scarcity style economy based on gifting. It was a really great
  description of what such a society could look like. I took issue with some
  weird love-triangle-like-shenanigans in the second half of the book, but
  the story arc more than makes up for it. Plus, the people throw a party

  I read this book purely for its description of Groebner bases and the Bucchberger
  algorithm in a way that <i><span class='centered'>made sense</i> for the first time.

  so I'm not going to repeat myself here. In general, I think it's a great book
  that's worth reading, if nothing else, for at least the chapter on Groebner
  bases.</li></ul>

  This document is the user manual of Lucid. I didn't fully understand the
  book, but what I understood as their main argument is that full access too
  looping is un-necessary to perform most of the tasks that we do. Rather,
  one can provide a "rich enough" set of combinators to manipulate streams
  that allows one to write all programs worthy of our interest.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span class='centered'> <a href=https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00548290/document><span class='centered'>Bundle Adjustment โ A Modern Synthesis</a>
  I learnt about Bundle Adjustment from a friend taking a course on robotics.
  The general problem is to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of a point cloud
  given 2D projections of the points and the camera parameters, as the camera
  moves in time. I found the paper interesting since it winds up invoking a
  decent amount of differential geometric and gauge theoretic language to
  describe the problem at hand. I was unable to see why this vocabulary helped
  in this use-case, but perhaps I missed the point of the paper. It was hard to
  tell.</li></ul>
<h4><a id=conclusions href='#conclusions'> ยง </a><span class='centered'> Conclusions</h4>
I always feel a little wrong posting this at the end of every year, since I
feel that among the things I cover under "read", I've internalized some things
far better than others: For example, I feel I understannd Riemannian geometry
far better than I do General Relativity. I try to put up the caveats at the
beginning of each section, but I'd really like a way to communicate my
confidence without reducing readability.
The final thing that I wish for is some kind of reading group? It's hard
to maintain a group when my interests shift as rapidly as they do, which
was one of the reason I really loved the AIRCS workshop: They were people
who were working on formal methods, compilers, type theory, number theory,
embedded systems, temporal logic... It was very cool to be in a group of
people who had answers and intuitions to questions that had bugged me for
some time now. I wonder if attending courses at a larger research university
feels the same way. My uni is good, but we have quite small population, which
almost by construction means reduced diversity.
I also wish that I could openly add more references to repos I've been working
on for a while now, but I can't due to the nature of academia and publishing.
This one bums me out, since there's a long story of a huge number of commits
and trial-by-fire that I think I'll be too exhausted to write about once the
thing is done.
Sometimes, I also wish that I could spend the time I spend reading <i><span class='centered'>disparate</i>
topics on <i><span class='centered'>focused reading on one topic</i>. Unfortunately, I feel like I'm not
wired this way, and the joy I get from sampling many things at the same time
and making connections is somehow much deeper than the joy I get by deeply
reading one topic (in exclusion of all else). I don't know what this says
about my chances as a grad student in the future <code>:)</code>.
