  Describes "supergeometry", where we analyze `Z[x1,..., xn, e1, ... en]`
  where the `ei` anticommute amongst themselves, and commute with the `xi`.
  This gives it a symplectic dimension (`ei`), regular space dimension (`xi`),
  plus a single `Z` dimension. This somehow leads to the notion that `Spec(Z)` ought
  to be thought of as a 3-manifold..

> The drama triangle is a social model of human interaction – the triangle maps
> a type of destructive interaction that can occur between people in conflict
> The triangle of actors in the drama are oppressors, victims and rescuers.
  **The Victim:** The Victim's stance is "Poor me!" The Victim feels
  victimized, oppressed, helpless, hopeless, powerless, ashamed, and seems
  unable to make decisions, solve problems, take pleasure in life, or achieve
  insight.  The Victim, if not being persecuted, will seek out a Persecutor and
  also a Rescuer who will save the day but also perpetuate the Victim's
  negative feelings.  **The Rescuer:** The rescuer's line is "Let me help you."
  A classic enabler, the Rescuer feels guilty if they don't go to the rescue.
  Yet their rescuing has negative effects: It keeps the Victim dependent and
  gives the Victim permission to fail. The rewards derived from this rescue
  role are that the focus is taken off of the rescuer. When they focus their
  energy on someone else, it enables them to ignore their own anxiety and
  issues. This rescue role is also pivotal because their actual primary
  interest is really an avoidance of their own problems disguised as concern
  for the victim’s needs.  **The Persecutor: (a.k.a. Villain):** The Persecutor
  insists, "It's all your fault." The Persecutor is controlling, blaming,
  critical, oppressive, angry, authoritarian, rigid, and superior.

- [From Tao's article on gauges](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/09/27/what-is-a-gauge/): 
    (i) Quivers. This theory basically concerns connections on vector bundles over
     (usually finite) directed graphs. One novel feature, over manifolds, is
     that the dimension of the “bundle” may change over different points. The
     “connection”, usually called a representation of the quiver, is a choice
     of linear map for each edge of the graph. If one fixes a gauge, i.e. a
     basis for each vector space, then the theory is boring — the space of
     connections is itself a big vector space. The interest is in the gauge
     transformations, whose group is the product of the general linear groups
     of the vector spaces. (ii) Currency trading

- [Tools for Convivality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tools_for_Conviviality)
> Radical monopoly is a concept defined by philosopher and author Ivan Illich
> in his 1973 book, "Tools for Conviviality," and revisited in his later work,
> which describes how a technology or service becomes so exceptionally dominant
> that even with multiple providers, its users are excluded from society
> without access to the product. His initial example is the effect of cars on
> societies, where the car itself shaped cities by its needs, so much so that
> people without cars become excluded from participation in cities. A radical
> monopoly is when the dominance of one type of product supersedes dominance by
> any one brand.  Social media as a technology in the forms of
> Facebook/Instagram/Twitter could be seen as a radical monopoly for
> reputation, as is Linkedin for employment, colleges for education, etc.  I
> think Illich's criticisms of car culture pushed him outside the Overton
> window of policy making, but his radical monopoly concept is a useful
> critical tool for reasoning about tech and ethics. A counter argument could
> use the example that the discovery of fire created a radical monopoly on
> heat, and therefore it's so general as to be applied arbitrarily to anything
> you don't like. However, being able to think about the consequences of a new
> radical monopoly might have on some aspect of human experience is useful for

  path that keeps us closest to `0`. See how much of the string stuff

- "You just pick the speed of light squared in Minkowski space to be an
  appropriate algebraic number, and magic happens! Suddenly solutions of
  natural PDE's on hyperbolic manifolds are linked with cohomology of
  arithmetic groups." I picked it up from a variety of sources, but I'd
  recommend reading anything by Alan Reid. He has some course notes floating
  around which cover arbitrary hyperbolic n-manifolds, though I can't seem to
  track them down at the moment.  People often focus on hyperbolic 3-manifolds
  because there are some very strong links to number theory (e.g. Spec(Z)
  behaves like a 3-manifold in certain ways), but the machinery works for
  higher dimensional hyperbolic manifolds as well. "Arithmetic hyperbolic
  manifolds" is a good keyword to look for if you want to dig deeper.
