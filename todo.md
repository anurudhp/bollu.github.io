- "You just pick the speed of light squared in Minkowski space to be an

  natural PDE's on hyperbolic manifolds are linked with cohomology of
  arithmetic groups." I picked it up from a variety of sources, but I'd
  recommend reading anything by Alan Reid. He has some course notes floating
  around which cover arbitrary hyperbolic n-manifolds, though I can't seem to
  track them down at the moment.  People often focus on hyperbolic 3-manifolds
  because there are some very strong links to number theory (e.g. Spec(Z)
  behaves like a 3-manifold in certain ways), but the machinery works for
  higher dimensional hyperbolic manifolds as well. "Arithmetic hyperbolic
  manifolds" is a good keyword to look for if you want to dig deeper.
